Changes to Empire 4.3.32 - Sun Aug 25 07:55:34 UTC 2013
 * Fix an LWP stack overflow observed on AIX 7.1.
 * Fix portability bug in standalone client Makefile
 * Fix portability bug in configure test for curses.
 * The break command now honors new designation of sanctuaries.
 * Changes to edit, give, setsector, setresource, swapsector:
   - Generalize edit to multiple objects: accept
     <SECTS|SHIPS|PLANES|LANDS|NATS> argument instead of just
     <SECT|SHIP|PLANE|LAND|NAT>.  Obsoletes setsector and setresource.
   - Make interactive "edit c" detect and handle concurrent updates,
     like other edits do.
   - Don't reprint edited object when done with it.
   - Always print a message describing the actual change.  Necessary
     to give the deity a chance to catch unexpected changes, e.g. a
     player moving away stuff right before a give command, leaving
     fewer items than the deity intends to take.  Existing messages
     improved, missing ones added.
   - Consistently send bulletins to the victim / beneficiary of deity
     meddling, except when changing stuff mortals can't see.
   - Report much more deity meddling in the news (subject to option
     GODNEWS).
   - More robust argument checking.  Before, careless deity edits
     could cause internal errors.  Much bounds checking was missing,
     inconsistent or wrong.
   - Teleport planes and land units to carrier on load.
   - Refuse to move planes and land units on carriers.
   - Fix stack smash in edit l key 'L' that can mess up sector file.
   - Fix setsector to again print actual landmine change for occupied
     sectors.  Broken in 4.3.31.
   - Suppress bulletins for acts of god to himself.
   - Suppress news for acts of god to gods.
   - Suppress news and bulletins on no-op acts of god.
   - Always send bulletins from POGO.  Name the meddling deity in the
     bulletin text instead.  Inconsistent since Chainsaw.
   - Make interactive edit accept empty key argument again.
   - Make interactive edit treat blank input like empty input.
   - Don't let edit put a land unit or plane on two carriers
   - Do not disclose when a deity destroys a ship, tell the ex-owner
     only that he lost it.
   - edit p and u now show the edited unit like edit s.
   - edit s now shows the edited ship even when its owner is invalid.
 * Clean up output of satellite, land, sorder and mission for world
   sizes between 200 and 1998.  cutoff and level still have issues
   there.
 * Plug harmless file descriptor leak on OpenBSD with IPv6.  Broken in
   4.3.31.
 * New doc/contributing explains how to contribute to Empire.
 * Code refactoring and cleanup.
 * Info page, manual page and documentation fixes and clarifications.

Changes to Empire 4.3.31 - Sun May 12 16:58:34 UTC 2013
 * Fix read beyond end of conditional argument on missing operand.
 * Don't put broken links into info pages formatted as HTML.
 * Permit ships that can drop depth charges, but not fire.  No such
   ships exist in the stock game.
 * Consistently require guns for dropping depth charges.  Before, only
   the fire command required guns (since 4.3.12 and before 4.0.6).
 * Change econfig key rollover_avail_max from 0 to 50.
 * Make sector production more predictable.  Commands production and
   budget are now a bit more accurate.
 * Fix bugs that messed up xdump lost and xdump trade on big endian
   hosts (broken in 4.3.8), and made the server fail during startup on
   most big endian hosts (broken in 4.3.12).
 * Build process robustness fixes.
 * Use "Level: Obsolete" to mark obsolete info pages, and drop "info
   Obsolete".
 * Server now uses IPv4 format for IPv4-mapped addresses.  Simplifies
   safe use of econfig key privip.
 * Server logs a few more network connection details.
 * Fixes and workarounds for econfig key listen_addr "" (which is the
   default) when the system has both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
   configured:
   - Server accepted only IPv6 connections on Windows and BSDs.  Fix
     to accept IPv4 ones, too.
   - Except for OpenBSD, where the fix doesn't work.  Accept IPv4
     connections instead of IPv6 ones there, and document how to get
     IPv6 accepted instead.
   - Linux systems are frequently configured in a way that makes the
     server accept only IPv4 connections.  Document workaround: use
     listen_addr "::".
 * Change fairland island size probability distribution: roll two dice
   instead of one.  This makes extreme sizes much less likely.
 * Make fairland record the island number in the deity territory.
 * Fix extension of market bidding time when high bidder changes.
   Introduced broken in 4.0.7, with insufficient fixes in 4.0.9 and
   4.2.0.
 * Fix market not to mess up ridiculously high unit prices.  Has been
   broken since 4.0.0 introduced the market.
 * Fix melting of big piles of stuff by ridiculously heavy fallout.
   Has been broken since fallout exists.
 * Fix crash on edit s, p, u key 'U' with negative argument.
 * When a deity builds ships or land units in foreign sectors, they're
   given to the sector owner.  This lets POGO build them, and it's how
   build works for planes and nukes.
 * Fix PRNG (pseudo-random number generator) seeding to resist
   guessing: seed with a kernel random number.  If we can't get one,
   fall back to a hash of high-resolution time and process ID.  This
   should happen only on old systems or Windows.  Far worse than a
   kernel random number, but far better than just low-resolution time.
   Fairland's seeding used to be low-resolution time and process ID,
   but regressed in 4.2.20 to just time.
 * Switch PRNG from BSD random() to Mersenne Twister.  This is a is a
   proven, high-quality PRNG.
 * Fix tiny error in distribution of some die rolls.
 * Increase land unit retreat chance and nuclear damage's chance to
   destroy a nuke by one percentage point, for simplicity.
 * Merge news items a bit more aggressively.
 * Fix a year 2038 bug in news item merging.
 * Retire the nightly build.
 * New make target check.  Just a few tests for now, derived from the
   smoke test that used to be part of the nightly build.
 * Really fix accepting connections from "long" IPv6 address.  The fix
   in 4.3.23 could mess up player's host address in player output and
   logs, and cause extra "Last connection" messages.
 * Take ship cost into account when picking missile interdiction
   target.  Broken in 4.3.8.
 * Really fix give, setsector and setresource not to wipe out
   concurrent updates.  The fix in 4.3.27 was insufficient.
 * Fix setsector not to disclose number of landmines to occupier.
 * Make capital fail more nicely when the sector is unsuitable.  Its
   argument must now be a single sector.  Before, it silently picked
   the first suitable one when the argument selected several.  Has
   always been that way, and never documented.
 * Changes to option GODNEWS:
   - Deity command give could downgrade the deity's relations to the
     sector owner when GODNEWS was enabled.  No more.
   - Likewise, deity commands edit and setsector can no longer
     downgrade the victim's relations to the deity.
   - News enabled by GODNEWS no longer affect news headlines.
 * Fix bomb, drop, fly, paradrop, recon and sweep to again accept a
   destination sector equal to the assembly point.  Broken in 4.3.27.
 * Fix portability bug in configure test for Windows API.
 * More user friendly server startup: journal open errors are detected
   while the server still runs in the foreground, which makes it
   possible to complain to stderr and to exit unsuccessfully.
 * Market changes:
   - Forbid selling conquered populace.  Only relevant when the deity
     allows selling civilians, which is probably a bad idea.
   - Permit selling military by default.
   - Forbid selling ships and land units carrying unsalable cargo.
 * Scrapping ships and land units now spreads the plague
 * Don't let scrap give away civilians, kill them off instead.
 * Pilots and air cargo now spread the plague.
 * Don't let fly and drop give away civilians.
 * Fix fly to permit flying civs to a carrier in an occupied sector.
   Broken in 4.2.17.
 * Don't let planes fly to a carrier without sufficient space.
   Before, planes that didn't fit were teleported home, which could be
   abused.  Broken in 4.3.17.  Almost the same bug was previously
   fixed in 4.2.17.
 * Fix tend to foreign ships:
   - Refuse to tend civilians to foreign ships.
   - Don't leak friendly foreign ships' commodity cargo.
   - Continue with remaining target ships after skipping a foreign one
     when tending a negative amount of commodities.
   All broken when Chainsaw 2 added tending to allies.
 * march sub-command 'm' can now sweep own landmines.
 * Land units no longer sweep allied landmines, except when executing
   march sub-command 'm'.  They don't hit them since 4.3.27.  Sweeping
   was forgotten then.
 * Fix bmap commands not to parse empty flags argument as "revert".
   Broken in 4.3.27.
 * Code refactoring and cleanup.
 * Info page fixes and clarifications.

Changes to Empire 4.3.30 - Tue May 22 18:34:52 UTC 2012
 * Disable damage to base sector or ship when missile explodes on
   launch for now, because damage done to other missiles there can be
   wiped out in some cases.  Broken in Empire 2.
 * Fix navigate and march not to wipe out concurrent updates.
   Abusable, but probably not worthwhile.
 * Fix some buffer overruns in fairland.  Has always been broken.
 * Fix arm to require nuke and plane to be in the same sector.  A
   remote nuke got teleported to its plane when the plane moved.
   Broken in 4.3.3.
 * Change login command kill (used by client option -k) to kill less
   ruthlessly: send a flash message and try to flush output, exactly
   like a server shutdown does.
 * Fix server shutdown to wait for player threads to reach a safe
   state.  Before, player threads raced with shutdown, and failed to
   update the treasury, record play time, and write log entries when
   they lost.  Bug goes back to Empire 2.  Patched partially or
   unsuccessfully in 4.2.10, 4.2.12, 4.2.20, 4.3.6, 4.3.10 and 4.3.23.
   The race was hard to lose in practice, until an unrelated
   "simplification" in 4.3.23 could get player threads stuck sending
   output after shutdown aborted a command.
 * Idle timeout changes:
   - The grace period for clients to complete login and logout is now
     separate from the idle timeout.  Configurable with new econfig
     key login_grace_time, default is 120 seconds.
   - The idle timeout for visitors is now separate from the one for
     players.  Configurable with new econfig key max_idle_visitor,
     default is five minutes.
   - Fix the idle timeout when the connection gets stuck sending
     output.  Broken in 4.3.20.
   - Idle timeout during execute now terminates the connection, not
     just the execute command.
 * Fix stack smash in build.  Remote hole!  Broken when Empire 2 added
   the confirmation prompt.
 * Fix stack smash in scrap and scuttle.  Remote hole!  Broken when
   Chainsaw added the confirmation prompt.  Additionally, the
   confirmation prompt is misleading when the player supplies
   conditionals.  Redesign the flawed prompt.
 * Fix execute's echo of the command.  Broken in 4.3.28.
 * The mobility cost of retreating a defending land unit was
   calculated for an uninitialized sector.  This could charge
   incorrect mobility, prevent retreat, or, if the stars align just
   right, crash the server.  Broken in 4.3.6.
 * Commands cutoff, headlines, land, lstat, motd, neweff, payoff,
   qorder, sorder, and wall now behave like the other information
   query commands when the player's connection can't take more output:
   they pause to let other code run.
 * Revised command permissions:
   - arm and disarm no longer require money, for consistency with the
     other commands to move stuff around.
   - satellite no longer requires money, for consistency with lookout,
     radar, sonar and skywatch.
   - qorder, sorder, survey and test no longer require a capital, for
     consistency with the other commands that report on stuff the
     player owns.
   - start and stop no longer require a capital, for consistency with
     the other commands to control production.
   - fortify now requires a capital, for consistency with mission,
     morale and range.
   - Anybody may now use country, echo and financial.
   - Visitors can no longer use census, commodity, map, nmap,
     sinfrastructure (useless without sectors), read (visitors don't
     get any telegrams), and change (always failed).
   - Players can no longer use map and nmap before break.  This is
     consistent with all the other commands to examine the
     environment.  It also prevents people from trying multiple
     unbroken countries in a blitz to find the one with the nicest
     vicinity.
   - Players can now use resource before break, just like census.
 * read could swallow the first telegram header when showing the
   telegrams that arrived while waiting for the player to confirm
   deletion.  Broken in 4.3.29.
 * Fix 'm' in path argument of explore, move, transport:
   - Don't moan about deprecated argument syntax ('m' without a space
     before its argument) even when there's no argument.
   - Recognize the flags argument again.
   Broken in 4.3.27.
 * Market fixes:
   - Command market is no longer available to visitors, because it
     triggers execution of trades that have become ready.
   - Fix a race condition that could cause commodity trades to be
     executed multiple times.  Abusing this to duplicate commodities
     seems tricky, but possible.  Broken in Empire 3.
   - Don't expropriate sellers of units.  POGO got the the money, the
     telegrams and made the news, the seller got nothing.  Broken in
     4.3.17.
 * Login command quit and server shutdown could lose player output.
   4.3.23 tried to fix the shutdown case, but the fix was incomplete.
 * Fix login command quit to really quit.  It sometimes just swallowed
   buffered input, at least on some systems.
 * 4.2.22's fairer command scheduling failed to cover the execute
   command.  Fix that.
 * When a client shuts down input transmission to log out, output
   could get lost.  Our client never does that.
 * Don't skip post command treasury update and status notification on
   EOF from player, after quit command, and when command is aborted by
   server shutdown.  An unluckily timed EOF or shutdown can deprive a
   player of money gained from scuttling tradeships or sacking a
   capital.  Can be abused to build bridges and infrastructure free of
   charge.  Can also be abused to designate sectors for free, but the
   stock game's sector types are all free anyway.  Has always been
   broken.
 * Fix client not to send an empty line on player interrupt (normally
   ^C) before the first command.  This was missed in 4.3.26.
 * Code and info page cleanup.
 * Documentation fixes.

Changes to Empire 4.3.29 - Fri Jan 20 19:20:20 UTC 2012
 * drop and fly from carrier could fail to load last civilian or
   military.
 * Telegram and announcement changes:
   - wire no longer loops to show announcements that arrived while
     waiting for the player to confirm deletion.
   - At most five seconds worth of messages are now squashed together
     into one.  Before, only the time between adjacent telegrams was
     limited, not the total time.
   - When telegrams arrived while read was waiting for the player to
     confirm deletion, and we then showed them, we nevertheless
     claimed "you have new telegrams" before the next command prompt.
     Only with toggle inform off.  Known bug since Empire 2.
   - Fix read not to clobber asynchronous notification of telegrams
     arriving while waiting for the player to confirm deletion.
   - Fix wire not to reset number of pending telegrams with toggle
     inform on.  Broken when Empire 2 introduced toggle inform.
   - The number of pending announcements was off when announcements
     were squashed together.
   - More careful error handling and logging.
 * Ensure all of an update's output goes into a single production
   report:
   - Avoid splitting it up when the update is slow.  Empire 2 already
     did that for the number of pending telegrams, but not for read.
   - Don't turn parts of it into BULLETINs.  Autonav and sail could do
     that since Empire 2.
 * files now creates POGO with user interface flags beep, coastwatch,
   sonar and techlists set, for consistency with add.
 * Change newcap back to not wiping the country (it wiped since
   4.3.12).  Additionally, leave levels and telegrams alone.
 * Changes to deity command add:
   - Require confirmation for unadvisable actions.
   - Refuse to touch a country while it's being played.
   - Don't crash on negative country number.
   - Create deities with money, just like files creates POGO.
   - Always reset the country completely, not just when adding a
     player or a visitor.
   - Rename argument "new" to "player".  Keep recognizing "new" for
     now, but deprecate it.
   - Drop argument "active".  If you really want to create a player
     country without a capital, add the player country normally, then
     activate it with edit instead of newcap.
   - Drop the obscure sector check and wipe option.  If you really
     need to wipe out a country, there's much more to wipe than just
     sectors.
   - Drop the undocumented land unit destruction feature.
 * Permit no-op country name change again.  Accidentally outlawed in
   4.3.20.
 * Plug a few minor memory and file descriptor leaks.
 * Fix use-after-free when plane gets shot down or aborted in
   dogfight.  Broken in 4.3.27.
 * Code cleanup.
 * Info page and manual page fixes.

Changes to Empire 4.3.28 - Sat Jul 16 11:30:53 UTC 2011
 * Don't let POGO (#0) navigate dead ships, and march dead land units.
   The ghosts even got sighted and interdicted, and could hit mines.
   Has always been that way.
 * llook can't see land units and planes loaded on land units anymore.
 * Fix board to ignore land units loaded on land units when testing
   whether a sector can board.  Broken in 4.0.17.
 * Fix transport to reject planes loaded on land units.  The plane
   remained on its carrier.  When the land unit moved, the plane was
   teleported right back to it.  Broken since Chainsaw 3 added land
   units.
 * Fix lradar not to let land units loaded on land units use radar.
   Broken since 4.0.0 added trains.
 * Fix strength to ignore land units loaded on land units.  Broken in
   4.2.0.
 * Fix navigate and march to find paths longer than a few sectors
   again (7 for 64 bit hosts, 3 for 32 bit hosts).  Broken in 4.3.27.
 * march sub-command 'i' now shows number of military and land units
   loaded.
 * New server option -F to force start even when state looks bad.
   Risks crashes and further corruption, but gives deities a chance to
   fix up a bad game state with edit commands and such.
 * empdump -x no longer refuses to export game state that looks bad.
   Gives deities another tool to fix up a bad game state.
 * Land units loaded on land units fight che again, as they used to
   before 4.3.26.
 * When a land unit dies fighting che, land units loaded on it get
   unloaded, and planes loaded on it die.  Before, the update left
   them stuck on their dead carrier.  Impact like the next item.
   Abusable.  Broken since Chainsaw 3 added land units.
 * The update no longer destroys ships, planes and land units for lack
   of maintenance.  Before, it left any embarked planes, land units
   and nukes on their dead carrier.  In this state, units behaved as
   if their carrier was still alive, with additional protection from
   the fact that a dead carrier can't be damaged or boarded.  If
   another unit with the same number got built, it picked up the stuck
   cargo.  The cargo got teleported to its new carrier when the
   carrier moved.  Abusable, but it involves going broke, so it's
   rarely practical.  Slightly more practical before 4.3.6 removed
   budget priorities.  Broken for ships and land units when Empire 2
   added their maintenance cost, and for planes when 4.3.3 replaced
   nuclear stockpiles by nuke units.
 * Fix bogus internal error triggered by navigate and march
   sub-commands 'r', 'l' and 's'.  Broken in 4.3.27.
 * Fix client not to reject redirections and execute containing
   non-ASCII characters with a bogus scary warning when using UTF-8.
 * Fix execute not to mangle non-ASCII characters in the argument when
   prompting for it while login option utf-8 is on.
 * Fix handling of non-ASCII and control characters in batch files.
 * Conversion from UTF-8 to ASCII ate the character following a
   replaced non-ASCII character.  Buffer overrun possible if the
   terminating zero gets eaten.  Could happen in players, read, flash,
   wall, and execute.
 * Fix handling of empty commands:
   - Time used was not updated.
   - Mortal player wasn't logged off for game hours, game down, and
     time limit.
   - Notifications were delayed: going broke, becoming solvent, new
     telegrams (toggle inform off only), new announcements, capital
     lost.
 * Minor tweaks to nightly build.
 * Server's and empdump's sanity checking of configuration and game
   state is now more rigorous.
 * Deity xdump no longer dumps unused countries' realms.
 * Remove option LANDSPIES.  Deities can customize the land table to
   disable spy units.
 * Remove option TRADESHIPS.  Deities can customize the ship table to
   enable trade ships.
 * Configuration table changes (builtin and custom):
   - Rows must be in ascending uid order.
   - Omitting rows in tables item, sect-chr and infrastructure is no
     longer permitted.
   - Custom tables now replace the builtin table completely.  Before,
     omitted rows defaulted to the builtin version, except at the end
     of a table.  Commenting out unwanted stuff just works now.
   - Permit custom table product having fewer than 14 entries.
   - Reject custom tables where customization has no effect (updates,
     table, meta, all symbol tables) or where it's unsafe (news-chr).
   - Input is checked more rigorously.
 * empdump -i fixes:
   - Don't touch plane file when import fails.
   - Refuse import of incorrectly sized table instead of silently
     creating one the server will reject.
   - Replace old state completely.  Before, omitted rows in the dump
     defaulted to the old state, except at the end of a table.
   - Input is checked more rigorously.
 * Fix xdump updates not to dump bogus extra updates.
 * Fix use-after-free when a plane got shot down or aborted by flak.
   Broken in 4.3.27.
 * Friendlier diagnostics in the build command.
 * Fix build to set nuke's tech exactly like for ships, planes and
   land units.  It's not currently used for anything.
 * Research required for nukes was slightly off sometimes due to
   incorrect rounding.
 * Bridge building required 0.005 tech less than advertised, fix.
 * "show nuke" now obeys toggle techlists.
 * Fix "show land s" to show columns xpl and lnd again.  Broken in
   4.3.15.
 * Code refactoring and cleanup.
 * Documentation on custom tables and xdump updated.
 * Info file fixes.

Changes to Empire 4.3.27 - Sun Apr 17 11:36:29 UTC 2011
 * License upgrade to GPL version 3 or later.
 * Fix buy not to wipe out concurrent updates.  Can be abused to
   duplicate commodities.
 * Don't let fighters, SAMs and ABMs intercept while on trading block.
 * Don't let missiles interdict ships or land units while on trading
   block.
 * Fix client to log long input lines untruncated.
 * Fix client crash for long input lines.
 * info subject pages now mark unusually long pages with a !.
 * The edit command keys deprecated in 4.3.15, 4.3.17 and 4.3.20 are
   now gone.
 * Fix give, setsector and setres not to wipe out concurrent updates.
 * Fix explore, move, test, transport not to ignore spaces in path
   arguments.  Broken in 4.3.7.  Deprecate use of 'm' without space
   before its argument.
 * Improvements to map drawing commands:
   - Don't fail silently when asked to draw a map around an invalid
     unit, explain the problem.
   - Deprecate bmap flag "r".  Use (a prefix of) "revert" instead.
   - bmap flags following "t" are no longer ignored.  However, info
     pages previously documented an argument "true" in addition to
     flag "t".  To keep that working, keep ignoring flags following
     "t" when they're bad.  But deprecate that usage.
   - Reverting the bmap no longer draws a map.
   - Bad conditionals could make the commands misinterpret their first
     argument.
   - The commands now fail when they reject their second argument.
 * The xdump syntax deprecated in 4.3.12 is now gone.
 * Fix satellite to fail on bad conditionals instead of ignoring them.
 * Journal improvements:
   - Optional logging of output.
   - Long lines are no longer truncated.
   - Login phase input is now logged, too.
   - Commands are now logged.  Allows making sense of input without
     context.
 * Option BRIDGETOWERS is now disabled by default.
 * Bridge towers now take 300 hcms to build, down from 400.
 * Fix stop orders to expire even when the country is broke.  Broken
   in 4.3.8.
 * Fix march and navigate not to advise on "legal directions" when
   path finding fails.
 * New path finder:
   - Much faster, especially for distribution, i.e. where it matters
     most.  Speedups in excess of 30x have been observed for updates
     taken from real games.
   - Old land path finder leaked memory occasionally.
   - Old land path finder overran buffers for very long paths.  A
     malicious player can arrange sufficiently long paths, but it
     takes a lot of land.  Distribution, the distribute command, land
     unit reaction, and automatic supply now handle arbitrary long
     paths.  Commands explore, move, test, transport, march, navigate
     and path now handle paths up to 1023 characters.  Command
     bestpath shows paths longer than 1023 characters with the tail
     replaced by "...".
   - Old sea and air path finder treated destinations as unreachable
     when the best path was longer than 99 characters.  Command sorder
     now handles arbitrary long paths.  Commands bomb, drop, fly,
     paradrop, recon, sweep and sail now handle paths up to 1023
     characters.  Autonav considers up to 1023 characters at the
     update.  Planes can fly missions up to 1023 sectors from their
     base.
 * Automatic supply charged mobility for the path back to the source
   instead forward to the sink.
 * Make bestpath work for deities in foreign land.
 * More robust savecore example script.
 * Fix buffer overruns in the lookout, spy, map and nmap commands when
   WORLD_X * WORLD_Y is not a multiple of 16.
 * The path command's maps weren't always fitted to the path
   correctly.  Broken in 4.3.17.
 * Land units no longer hit allied mines.
 * Change sharebmap with yourself to do nothing instead of telling you
   you're not friendly to yourself.
 * You can now flash yourself.  Enjoy!
 * A race condition could make the flash command claim an ally was not
   logged on when he was.  Hard to trigger outside the lab.
 * The flash command no longer prints "Flash sent" for deities.  It's
   annoying.  It never did that for mortals.
 * Plug memory leaks in mission code on a number of conditions:
   - Submarines moving where own planes would interdict hostile
     submarines
   - Ground combat where countries hostile to one of the parties would
     support if relations were right (allied to one party, at war with
     the other)
   - Ships or land units moving within hostile missile mission op
     areas
   - Any player action within marine missile mission op areas that
     could trigger the missile owners' missions.
 * Attack fixes:
   - When you ordered a sector to attack with military, but lost the
     sector before the attack was executed, and the new owner was
     allied to you, the server got confused: it let the military
     attack even though they were already dead, but not occupy.
   - When you ordered a land unit to attack from an allied sector, and
     the sector got lost before the attack was executed, the server
     reported things as if you had owned the sector yourself.  The
     land unit still attacked when the new owner was also allied to
     you.  No more.
   - When a land unit attacked out of an allied sector, its mobility
     cost was computed as if the ally owned the land unit.  Attacking
     sectors old-owned by that ally was too cheap, and taking back
     one's own was too expensive.
 * Fix trade ships to pay off in own harbor.  Broken in 4.3.17.
 * Remove option SLOW_WAR.  It hasn't been enabled in a public game
   for years, and the code implementing it was buggy.
 * Fix a bug in sail that limited the sail path to 27 instead of the
   intended 28 characters.
 * Fix race condition in transmission of flash and telegram
   information messages that could double output and possibly crash
   the server.
 * Planes get to sweep and sonar only after flak and interception.
 * Don't limit the radar command's range to fit its output into a
   world map without clipping.  The limiting goes back to Chainsaw 2.
 * Make flak vs. pinpoint bombing consistent with ordinary flak:
   - 4.3.6 reduced the plane abort chance on damage, but missed the
     additional flak vs. pinpoint bombing.  Fix that.
   - Fix to charge mobility appropriate for damage.
 * Prettier flak damage reporting.
 * Fix bugs that could cause bmap updates from recon and satellite to
   be lost.
 * Fix lookout to properly report sector ownership to deities.
 * Suppress bogus messages deities with non-zero country number got
   when attempting to navigate foreign ships or march foreign land
   units.  Such deity use hasn't worked since Empire 2.
 * Deities can no longer fly foreign planes.  It didn't fully work
   since Chainsaw 3, and can trigger internal errors since 4.3.11.
 * Don't split lines over several bulletins.  The read command
   normally merges these bulletins, but if they are more than five
   seconds apart (clock jumped somehow), we get a bulletin header in
   the middle of a line.  Broken since Empire 2.
 * Don't beep when plane, land unit or nuke die on a collapsing
   bridge.  Not nice, because it could beep many times, and could put
   beeps in bulletins.  Beeping was added in 4.0.18.
 * Minor improvements to nuclear damage reporting.
 * When a deity dropped a foreign nuke, parts of the output went to
   the owner of the nuke instead of the deity.
 * When a player triggered a foreign missile launch (mission or
   interception), and the missile exploded on launch, part of the
   report went to the player instead of the missile owner.  This
   disclosed the missile owner's origin.  Broken in Empire 2.
 * When autonav reported to a ship owner that it can't load or unload
   foreign civilians, it used the sector owner's coordinate system.
   This disclosed the sector owner's origin.  Abusable.
 * When nuclear damage bounced off a sanctuary, the bulletin to the
   sanctuary owner used the attacker's coordinate system.  This
   disclosed the attacker's origin.
 * When a deity used sweep, lmine, sail or sabotage with a foreign
   plane, land unit or ship, its location was reported in the foreign
   coordinate system.
 * When a deity asked for a foreign nation report, the capital
   location was reported in the foreign coordinate system.
 * Code refactoring and cleanup.
 * Info file improvements.

Changes to Empire 4.3.26 - Mon May 24 16:37:40 UTC 2010
 * Land units loaded on ships or land units can no longer fight che.
 * When foreign land units were present, a che revolt could damage
   them instead of the defending land units.  This could let defenders
   survive the revolt.  They were captured or blown up if che took
   over the sector.
 * Fix che revolt to damage only land units that actually fight
 * Fix loading x-light missiles on ships without capability plane.
   These ships could only use their x-light slots for x-light planes,
   not their plane slots.  Broken in 4.3.17.
 * Update bmap when nuclear detonation makes wasteland.
 * Fix fly and drop to report discarded cargo items correctly.
 * New client option -s to specify server host and port.
 * Hitting landmines could crash the server.  When not, the damage
   reduction for capability engineer was applied unpredictably.
   Broken in 4.3.24.
 * Fix retreat and lretreat condition 'c'.  Broken in 4.3.16.
 * coastwatch and skywatch could see too far.  Up to one sector for
   practical radar ranges.
 * skywatch now reports satellite uids.  The uid is required for
   launching a-sats since 4.3.23.
 * Fix client not to send an empty line of input before aborting the
   command on player interrupt (normally ^C).
 * Fix sabotage not to kill the spy every time.  Broken in 4.3.17.
 * Code cleanup.
 * Info page fixes, manual page improvements.

Changes to Empire 4.3.25 - Sun Mar 21 08:27:37 UTC 2010
 * Hitting seamines could crash the server.  When not, the damage
   reduction for capability sweep was applied unpredictably.  Broken
   in 4.3.24.
 * When an interdiction did damage other than collateral damage, the
   planes that intercepted it from interdicted carriers used no
   petrol.  4.3.24 fixed only the "no damage" case.
 * Ship anti-missile defense failed to charge shells when the ship was
   interdicted.  The fix in 4.3.24 covered only launch.
 * Fix a bug in navigate and march that let players lay mines free of
   charge.  Also fix them not to prompt for the number of mines.
 * Missile exploding on launch could not damage its base if it was
   armed with a nuke.  Broken in 4.3.23.
 * When a torpedo attack triggered a return torpedo, the news reported
   it to be fired by the attacker instead of the defender.
 * Interdiction attacked submarines with surface-only weapons.  Broken
   in 4.3.24.
 * Fix a bug in lradar, path, radar, route, satellite, sect and survey
   that could leak maps to other players.  Broken in 4.2.0.  Fixed in
   4.2.8 for bmap, lbmap, lmap, map, nmap, pbmap, pmap, sbmap and smap
   only.
 * files could clobber the game when reading confirmation fails.
 * fairland no longer rejects small worlds without trying.

Changes to Empire 4.3.24 - Tue Jan 26 21:29:14 UTC 2010
 * The client sometimes hung under Windows when the server closed the
   connection.  Broken in 4.3.23.
 * Fix navigate and march not to crash the server when a path argument
   consists of a valid path plus whitespace.  Broken in 4.3.7.
 * When a client sent a blank line in the login phase, the server
   crashed on some systems.
 * Fix crash bug in bomb, drop, fly, paradrop, recon and sail.  Broken
   in 4.3.16.
 * Fix bogus internal error on escort, recon, and satellite launch.
   Mostly harmless, as error recovery worked fine.  Broken in 4.3.23.
 * Stop ship and land unit movement on interdiction even when it does
   no damage.
 * When an interdiction did no or only collateral damage, the planes
   that intercepted it from interdicted carriers used no petrol, and
   interdicted land units were immune to collateral damage.
 * The limit for the number of sectors, ships, planes, land units,
   nukes, and so forth is now large enough not to matter.  It used to
   be 32768 on common machines.  The sector limit was introduced in
   4.3.12.  World x- and y-size are still limited to 65536 on common
   machines.
 * News use much less space, and thus I/O.  Space was wasted in
   4.3.12.  Side effects of the change:
   - Expiry of old news no longer updates news timestamps.  Updating
     timestamps was wrong, because it defeated incremental xdump news.
   - The empdump utility can no longer update timestamps of imported
     news.  Unfortunate, as it breaks incremental xdump news.
 * New news selector duration, the time span covered by this news item
   in seconds.
 * ABMs failed to charge supplies when their sector was the
   intercepted missile's target.  The stock game's ABMs use no
   supplies.
 * Ship anti-missile defense failed to charge shells when the ship was
   the missile's target.
 * Code refactoring and cleanup.

Changes to Empire 4.3.23 - Sun Dec 13 16:34:49 UTC 2009
 * Fix missile interception not to intercept tactical and marine
   missiles attacking missiles or satellites.  No such missiles exist
   in the stock game.  Interception of tactical ABMs could crash the
   server.  Broken in Empire 2.
 * Missiles missing their target do collateral damage again.  Was
   disabled because of bugs in 4.0.18 for manual launch and in 4.3.16
   for automatic launch.
 * News reported victim as actor for sub-launched anti-sat and ABM.
 * Defense value of missiles vs. ABMs and satellites vs. anti-sats
   failed to improve with tech.
 * Fix a bug that let missiles interdict ships outside their op area.
   This could happen when a group navigating together was partly
   inside the op area.
 * Only bomb strategic and launch at sector can use nukes.  Before,
   they could also be used by missions, bomb pinpoint, and launch at
   ships, but there were several bugs and inconsistencies, and the
   code was messy.  The arm command now rejects marine missiles in
   addition to satellites, ABMs and SAMs, and clears the mission.  The
   mission command now rejects planes armed with nukes.
 * Missiles exploding on launch pad no longer set off their nukes.
 * The launch command now more accurately reports why a missile can't
   be equipped.  It no longer draws supplies automatically.
 * Manually launched anti-sat now always kills when it hits, for
   consistency with automatically launched ones.
 * Don't permit nukes on satellites, ABMs and SAMs.  Nukes on
   satellites could be armed and disarmed even in orbit.  Nukes on
   ABMs and SAMs were lost without effect when their missile
   intercepted.  The stock game is not affected, because its
   satellites, ABMs and SAMs all have zero load.
 * Remove obsolete plane capabilities stealth and half-stealth.  Not
   used by the stock game.
 * Penalize fighter combat value for any load, not just bombs.  The
   stock game's fighters can't carry anything but bombs.
 * Make bomb work for non-tactical cargo bomber.  No such planes exist
   in the stock game.
 * Revised cargo plane rules: a cargo flight can be either an airlift
   or an airdrop now.  Airlifts carry more cargo than airdrops.  A
   cargo drop or paradrop with a non-VTOL plane is an airdrop.
   Anything else is an airlift.  This makes paradrop loads consistent
   with drop loads.  Paradrop with VTOL transports now carries twice
   the punch, and drop with non-VTOL transports hauls less than fly.
   In particular, the stock game's tr can't drop guns anymore.
 * Enforce plane selection rules more tightly:
   - bomb command can select only planes with capability bomber or
     tactical.  Before, other planes with non-zero load flew along,
     but their bombs were silently lost.
   - sweep command can select only planes with capability sweep.
     Before, other planes performed ordinary reconnaissance instead.
   - drop command can select only planes with capability cargo.
     Before, other planes flew along but dropped nothing.
 * Fix paradrop to fail without destroying the paratroopers when the
   player owns the target sector.
 * Launching an anti-sat now takes the target plane as argument.
   Before, it took a sector argument, and targeted the lowest-numbered
   satellite there.  Rather inconvenient when your own satellite masks
   one of the enemy's.
 * Remove option PINPOINTMISSILE.  Deities can customize the plane
   table to disable marine missiles.
 * Ridiculously impotent nukes could do unpredictable interdiction
   damage.  No such nukes exist in the stock game.
 * The production command could mispredict resource-depleting level
   production.  No such products exist in the stock game.  In fact,
   they'd be highly unusual.
 * The update could crash or corrupt the game when a (misconfigured)
   product depleted resource "none".
 * Revamp the Windows port based on ideas stolen from Gnulib.  Share
   the code between server and client.
 * Don't log out player when update aborts a command under Windows.
   Broken in 4.3.20, and not fully fixed in 4.3.21.
 * Fix accepting connections from hosts with "long" IPv6 address.  The
   internal buffer had insufficient space.
 * Delay shutdown up to 3s to let player output buffers drain.
 * Fix a race between main thread and player threads, which could
   theoretically make the server crash on start.
 * Clean up synchronization between commands, update and shutdown, and
   when player threads sleep on I/O.
 * Clean up the cruft that has accumulated in and behind the empio
   interface, and, to a lesser degree, the empthread interface.
 * Fix time difference underflows in pthread and Windows code.  They
   could potentially cause hangs, although none have been observed.
 * Make budget's "Sector building" line look better.
 * Make sector maintenance cost configurable.  New sect-chr selector
   maint.  Capitals now pay maintenance regardless of efficiency.
 * Overhaul show sect b.
 * Fix mine production resource limit for sector peffic != 100.  This
   affects mountains in the stock game, but only with an impractically
   large number of ETUs per update.
 * Code refactoring and cleanup.
 * Info file fixes and improvements.

Changes to Empire 4.3.22 - Sat Apr 25 11:56:29 UTC 2009
 * Fix a Windows client bug that could lead to hangs, at least with
   some versions of the C run-time.  Broken in 4.3.11.
 * Allow building without curses terminfo.  Highlighting in the client
   doesn't work then.
 * Really fix bomb not to wipe out plane updates made while it asked
   for pinpoint targets.  The fix in 4.3.21 didn't cover escorts.
 * Fix tend land not to wipe out concurrent updates.
 * Automatic supply fixes:
   - Ships with just two shells could fire a torpedo to return fire or
     interdict.
   - Ships with just one shell could use their anti-missile defense.
   - Land units were considered in supply even when they had not quite
     enough supplies.  Such land units could defend without penalty,
     attack and react.
   Broken in 4.3.20.
 * Fix update to take dead units off carriers.
 * Standalone client distribution built empire instead of empire.exe
   for Windows.  Broken in 4.3.0.
 * Fix client to abort script execution on SIGINT.
 * Fix Windows client not to hang on EOF on standard input when that
   is a tty.
 * Fix a client bug that could make it hang when EOF on standard input
   follows an execute command closely.
 * Seamines under bridge spans were disabled a long time ago, in
   Empire 2.  The drop command refuses to mine there.  Change mine
   command to do so as well.
 * Seamines under bridge spans were mistaken for landmines by ground
   combat, land units retreating from bombs, and non-land unit ground
   movement.
 * When a bridge tower collapsed, its landmines magically became
   seamines.
 * Don't log out player when he interrupts a command.  Broken in
   4.3.19.
 * Code cleanup and portability improvements.
 * Info file and documentation fixes.

Changes to Empire 4.3.21 - Mon Mar  9 21:34:52 UTC 2009
 * Fix swapsector not to wipe out concurrent changes to the swapped
   sectors.
 * Fix a bug in crash dumping that could mess up the journal and, at
   least in theory, mess up commands info, read, turn, and wire;
   announcement expiry, and reading of econfig and schedule.
 * Fix bomb not to wipe out plane updates made while it asked for
   pinpoint targets.
 * When bombing ships with a force containing both planes with and
   without capability ASW, the bomb command could fail to report
   presence of submarines, and could refuse to bomb ships when there
   were only submarines.
 * Leaving land units behind after a victorious attack could in some
   cases wipe out changes made to them since the victory.
 * The timestamp selectors added to commodity, load and trade in
   4.3.12 could lead to spurious command failures.  None have been
   observed in the wild.
 * Don't log out player when update aborts a command.  Broken in
   4.3.20.
 * Code refactoring and cleanup.

Changes to Empire 4.3.20 - Fri Feb 20 18:14:20 UTC 2009
 * Option LOANS is now disabled by default.
 * Option RAILWAYS is now enabled by default.
 * Many fixes to automatic supply:
   - Planes flying interception or support missions, abms intercepting
     ballistic missiles, and the launch command for missiles and
     anti-sats could all supply more shells than necessary, lose
     shells, or conjure them up.
   - Ships shooting down marine missiles could supply more shells than
     necessary, or lose shells.
   - Supply ships could conjure up shells when firing guns using
     multiple shells, or launching torpedoes, or dropping depth
     charges, or shooting down marine missiles.  No supply ships
     capable of doing that exist in the stock game.
   - Supply engineers could conjure up shells when laying mines.  They
     don't exist in the stock game.
   - load, lload and supply could supply land units with enough food
     from the sector containing them to starve the sector.
   - Sectors were charged too much mobility for moving supplies
     sometimes.
   - Land units serving as supply source no longer draw supplies
     recursively, because the bugs there are too hard to fix to be
     worth it.
   - Defending and reacting units only checked whether they could draw
     supplies, but didn't actually draw them.
   - load, lload, supply, assault and board no longer supply land
     units from ships carrying them.  This feature, added in 4.0.14,
     was inconsistent with other ways to supply.
   - Don't use automatic supply to avoid starvation at the update.  It
     adds complexity to the update.  How much good it does to players
     is highly doubtful; certainly nobody can rely on it.  It isn't
     covered by the starvation command.  Ships or land units could
     steal enough food from their sector to make it starve.
   - lmine could only fetch shells for engineers that use ammo.  The
     stock game's engineers all do.
   The changes listed for load and lload are actually lies, because
   supply has been disabled there since 4.3.17.
 * Don't let an engineer lay mines while it is on a ship or land unit,
   or in a foreign sector.
 * Sectors and ships no longer need shells to fire flak.
 * Use IPv4 and v6 only when suitable interfaces are configured.
 * Fix turn off not to fail when the message is empty.  Broken in
   4.2.20.
 * Don't nag the deity about game hours restriction in force all the
   time.
 * Tell deity when the game is down, just like players.  Also make the
   information available in xdump, as game selector down.
 * Corrupt mailboxes could crash the server.
 * Fix reject accept.  Broken in 4.3.4.
 * If a player was at a prompt when the deity turned the game down, he
   was allowed to enter one more command.
 * Air defense is no longer separate from interception.  Putting a
   plane on air defense now merely changes where it intercepts.
   Separate air defense added too much pointless complexity.  Its
   implementation violated design assumptions of the intercept code.
   Because of that, the same plane could intercept both an air defense
   mission and the planes that triggered it, and the damage it
   received in the first interception was wiped out.
 * Intercept the same all along the flight path.  In each sector, any
   country owning the sector, a surface ship or a land unit there gets
   to intercept.  Before, only the sector owner got to intercept,
   except for the assembly point and the target sector.  In the target
   sector, any country owning surface ships or land units got to
   intercept in addition to the sector owner.  Thus, a sector owner
   with surface ships or land units there got to intercept twice.  The
   sector owner did not get to intercept at the assembly point,
   even when it was the target sector.
 * Spotting rule changes:
   - Ships and land units now spot overflying planes along all of the
     flight path instead of just the target sector, and no longer
     report allied planes.
   - Planes now spot ships and land units only when flying recon or
     sweep, and along all of their flight path instead of just the
     target sector.  It still takes a spy plane to identify ships and
     land units.
   - Planes now spot ships and land units in a sector even when all
     planes abort there.
   - Planes now spot all foreign ships and land units, not just
     hostile ones.
 * Fix SAM interception for intercepts other than the first.
 * Fix air defense and flak over sectors allied to the planes.  Air
   defense was broken in Empire 2.  Flak was broken in 4.2.8.
 * Establishing contact by spotting planes from sectors didn't work.
 * Fix reconnaissance patrols to use sonar when any capable plane is
   present.  Before, all planes had to be capable.
 * Fix recon and sweep not to spy after all spy planes are gone.
 * Fix a bug that made multiple clients running on the same Windows
   machine interfere with each other.  Broken in 4.3.11.
 * Fix enforcing game hours for players already logged in.  Broken in
   4.3.19.
 * Fix distribution not to abandon a distribution center by exporting
   the last military.
 * Many fixes to load, unload, lload and lunload:
   - Now usable for deities.
   - Plug loopholes that let you steal foreign commodities by making
     load/lload unload and unload/lunload load through use of negative
     amount arguments.
   - Fix not to let you give away civilians.
   - You can't use lload in foreign sectors or lunload with foreign
     land units anymore.  Loading stuff in foreign sectors was
     prohibited already for ships.
   - lload and lunload now work on foreign land units only when
     they're explicitly named by uid.  This matches behavior of load
     and unload.
   - Fix to test relations of foreign object's owner to player instead
     of the other way round.
 * Make sure land units with maximum mobility can attack mountains.
 * Fix land unit attack mobility cost.  Broken in 4.3.6.
 * Conditions comparing string-valued selectors like wing to unquoted
   values are now interpreted more smartly.  Before, unquoted strings
   were prone to be interpreted as selector names even when that made
   no sense.  You still have to disambiguate truly ambiguous cases
   like w=w for planes, e.g. as wing=w or w='w'.
 * Fix reporting of shot spies in news.  Broken in 4.3.16.
 * Remove econfig key mission_mob_cost.  Questionable feature, and
   hasn't been used in a long time.
 * Reserve and escort missions now have an op-area, like all the other
   missions.
 * Land units now react only when on a reserve mission.  The lrange
   command is gone.  The edit command still accepts and ignores the
   land unit key 'P' for compatibility, but it is deprecated.
 * Fix a bug that could mess up mission op-area when the range of
   ship, plane or land unit on the mission decreases, e.g. through the
   range command.
 * Reserve missions no longer give a bonus to reaction range.
 * Info file fixes.
 * Code refactoring and cleanup.

Changes to Empire 4.3.19 - Sun Dec  7 23:15:34 UTC 2008
 * LWP doesn't work with Darwin due to OS bugs, avoid it for now.
 * Don't let ships double-retreat first on 'i' (injured) and then on
   'h' (helpless) when shelled.
 * Fix a bug that suppressed the "sunk!" message.  Broken in 4.3.17.
 * Log out player when maximum time per day is exceeded.  Before, he
   could remain logged in with visitor privileges only, but once
   logged out could not log back in.
 * If a player was at a prompt when either game hours restriction
   started or maximum time per day was exceeded, he was allowed to
   enter one more command.
 * Deitying a capital failed to charge money and report news.  Broken
   in 4.3.17.
 * Overhaul accounting of play time, fixing minor inaccuracies.
 * Fix parsing of 24:00 in econfig key game_hours and
   update_demandtimes.
 * New option RAILWAYS.
 * Che ages just like military reserves (1% per 24 ETUs).
 * Permit ships to assault the sector they're in.
 * Sectors eating less than one unit of food don't make one unit of
   food for free anymore.  They still can't starve.
 * New concept sector terrain.  Deities can use it to make sectors
   other than wilderness redesignatable.  See sect.config for more
   info.
 * Represent play time in seconds rather than minutes.  This affects
   xdump: nat selector minused (counting minutes) is replaced by
   timeused (counting seconds).
 * Improved nightly build, with additional tests.

Changes to Empire 4.3.18 - Sat Oct 18 18:39:17 UTC 2008
 * Fix building of planes, land units and nukes with uids that have
   never been used before.  This could crash the server on some
   systems in certain states.  Broken in 4.3.17.
 * Improved nightly build, with restructured and extended tests.

Changes to Empire 4.3.17 - Sat Sep 20 16:07:44 UTC 2008
 * Fix standalone client build for Windows.  Broken in 4.3.11.
 * Disable automatic supply of land units on load for now, it's
   broken, and can be abused to duplicate supplies.
 * Make trade show exactly what's on sale, remove option SHOWPLANE.
 * Stop ships, planes, land units and nukes on violent takeover, just
   like sectors.
 * Wipe orders when ships, planes, land units and nukes are taken over
   violently or given away peacefully.  Fleet, wing, army and mission
   were already cleared in many, but not all cases.  Other orders were
   never cleared: mission op-areas (visible in xdump), ship autonav
   orders, ship sail path (including ship to follow and mobility
   quota), land unit retreat orders, plane range limit, and land unit
   retreat percentage.
 * Fix takeover of stuff by attack, assault, board, lboard, paradrop
   and pboard:
   - Corrupt land unit file could lead to infinite recursion.
   - Take over nuke armed on plane along with the plane.  Broken in
     4.3.3.
   - Taking over land units with negative mobility increased mobility
     to zero.  Ditto for planes embarked on ships or land units.
 * Fix a bug that made set and xdump not recognize unused trade lots
   as such.
 * Fix giving away stuff by trading it:
   - When an armed nuke is sold separately from its plane, take it off
     the plane.  You couldn't do that before 4.3.3.
   - Give away nuke armed on sold plane along with the plane.  Broken
     in 4.3.3.
   - Don't zero mobility of planes and land units on sold ships.
 * Fix giving away stuff by unloading from its carrier: Give away any
   nukes armed on planes (broken in 4.3.3) and land units loaded on
   land units.  The latter can't happen in the stock game.
 * Fix giving away stuff by scrapping or scuttling its carrier:
   - Fix up output.
   - Disarm the nuke from a plane instead of destroying it.
   - Give away any loaded land units and planes, too.
 * Tradeship fixes:
   - Fix scuttle to ask for confirmation when scuttling a tradeship in
     an unsuitable sector even when the tradeship is pirated.  Broken
     in 4.2.13.
   - Fix scuttle to require 2% harbor efficiency for a trade ship to
     pay.  Also require at least friendly relations.
   - Make autonav refuse scuttle orders in unsuitable sectors.
 * Clean up rules on where you can scrap stuff:
   - Ships in own or friendly, efficient harbors (relations used not
     to matter, contrary to info)
   - Planes in own or allied, efficient airfields (friendly used to
     work as well, contrary to info)
   - Land units in any own or allied sector (relations used not to
     matter, and you couldn't scrap them on ships)
   Also tell player why something can't be scrapped instead of
   ignoring it silently.
 * Rewrite the broken code to move land units, planes and nukes along
   with their carrier.  The old code was a hack that didn't update
   timestamps (so incremental dumps didn't pick up the movement), and
   it didn't cover all uses.  The update, in particular, was prone to
   see cargo in old locations, which could screw up repairs.
 * Expire lost items at the update instead of continuously.
 * Replace econfig key lost_items_timeout by lost_keep_hours.
 * Minor Windows threading fixes.
 * Journal now uses human-readable names to identify threads.
 * Ship and land unit load counters are no longer stored in game
   state, because they duplicate information already there.  Same for
   the type of nuke loaded on a plane.  Remove field nuketype from
   xdump plane.  Clients can simply find the plane's nuke instead.
   The edit command still accepts and ignores the plane key 'n' for
   compatibility, but it is deprecated.
 * Ship and land unit load counts as displayed by ship, sdump, land,
   ldump, ship selectors nplane, nxlight, nchoppers, nland, and land
   selectors nxlight, nland are now reliable.  They used to get out of
   sync at times.
 * Ship load counts now reflect what is loaded, not how it is stored.
   For instance, if a light carrier, capable of carrying 4 x-lights
   and 20 light planes carries nothing but 5 sams, we now have
   nxlight=5, nplane=0 instead of nxlight=4, nplane=1.
 * New cargo lists data structure to let code find loaded planes, land
   units and nukes easily and efficiently.
 * Revamped upkeep of lost file.  It should be reliable now.
 * Disable the ill-advised error recovery on sector access that swept
   bugs under the carpet rather than recovering from them.
 * Occupied sectors no longer revert to the old owner when all
   military and land units go away.  This feature was added in
   Chainsaw 3.  It wasn't integrated properly with the che code
   (things went wrong when che killed all defenders, but couldn't
   convert the sector due to its loyalty), and combat code (if an
   attack killed off all local defenders and got defeated by reacting
   units, the sector changed ownership anyway, silently).
 * Include destination coordinates in interception and plane mission
   messages.
 * Client could misdiagnose redirections and executes as unauthorized,
   or die outright.  Broken in 4.3.11.
 * Fix xdump realm to dump player instead of absolute coordinates.
   Disclosed the true origin.  Broken in 4.3.0.
 * Fix spy to reliably avoid spying same sector more than once.
 * The map drawing code could smash the heap when the world was
   ridiculously small.
 * When a satellite's launch trajectory was off, its coordinates could
   get screwed up, which made it invisible in skywatch.
 * Fix several bugs that made the path command screw up when the path
   spans large areas.
 * Fix the default size of the map shown by move, test and transport
   sub-command M.
 * Fix bugs that could make arguments in area or dist syntax miss
   ships, planes, land units and nukes at the border of the selected
   area, if that area spans the whole world.  In sufficiently small
   worlds, it could also make radar miss satellites and ships, sonar
   miss ships, satellite miss ships and land units, nuclear
   detonations miss ships, planes, land units and nukes, automatic
   supply miss ship and land unit supply sources, ships and land units
   fail to return fire, ships fail to fire support.
 * Maps sometimes showed x-coordinates as three lines instead of two
   unnecessarily.
 * Improved nightly build, tests in particular.
 * Code refactoring and cleanup.

Changes to Empire 4.3.16 - Sat Aug  9 15:56:52 UTC 2008
 * Production command incorrectly limited the number of graduates,
   happy strollers, technological breakthroughs and medical
   discoveries produced by a sector to 999.  Broken in 4.2.15.
 * Fix a bug in improve that could let you spend more money than you
   have.
 * Fix work command not to spend more mobility than requested, and to
   round mobility use randomly instead of down.
 * Commands demobilize, convert and work no longer let you spend more
   money than you have.  Commands demobilize and convert no longer ask
   for confirmation before spending more than half your money.  Saving
   that feature would have been more work than it's worth.
 * Remove undocumented key 'd' at bomb ship, plane and land unit
   target prompts.
 * Fix land unit flak when pin-bombed to match flak when overflown:
   proportional to efficiency, and randomly rounded.  Was missed in
   4.3.6.
 * Don't permit bombing of embarked planes and land units.
 * Fix capital maintenance to charge at 60% efficiency.
 * launch command now requires only 40% plane efficiency, for
   consistency with other ways to launch missiles.
 * Disable collateral damage when automatically launched missiles miss
   their target.  Collateral damage was done even when the launch
   failed or the missile got intercepted.  It's been disabled for
   manually launched missiles since 4.0.18, for the same reason.
 * Fix a bug that corrupted the lostitems file.  Broken in 4.3.12.
 * Show command changes:
   - Move product information from "show sect c" into new "show
     product", and reformat it to be easier to understand.
   - New column navigability in "show sect s".
   - "show sect s" now shows the packing bonus type instead of
     selected packing bonuses.  "show item" shows the actual bonuses
     for each type.
   - "show sect b" now shows the usual values in addition to unusual
     ones.
 * Fix interdiction to obey op-area for missiles.
 * Fix a bug that caused a stale sources.mk to be distributed in the
   4.3.14 an 4.3.15 tarballs.  The latter does not build out of the
   box because of that.
 * Don't strip tab characters from quoted command arguments.  Broken
   in 4.2.21.
 * shutdown commands now always take effect immediately.  Before, they
   could be delayed by up to a minute.
 * shutdown could start multiple shutdown threads when you initiated a
   shutdown shortly after cancelling one.  This screwed up the timing
   of the shutdown.
 * Deity syntax of zdone changed, and is now documented in info.
 * The threshold command could be tricked into accepting negative
   thresholds.
 * Fix designate to always write updated bmap to disk.
 * Fix bomb to fail on empty <pin|strat> argument instead of flying
   without bombs.
 * Fix a bug in distribute that screwed up the current sector's
   distribution center when the command got aborted.
 * Commands arm, bomb, deliver, drop, fire, fly, paradrop, recon,
   lmine, order, power, range, sail, shutdown, sweep and tend did not
   honor command abortion at some prompts.
 * Fix a bug in handling of EOF from client that could bite in the
   following ways:
   - EOF at target prompts for bombing commodities, ships, planes and
     land units sent the server into an infinite loop that ate all
     memory.
   - EOF at sail's path prompt crashed the server.
   - EOF at some prompts in deliver, designate, fly, morale, zdone,
     attack and assault didn't abort the command.
   Broken in 4.3.11.
 * Selector terr is now the same as terr0 for mortal players, and
   dterr for deities.  This matches how the territory command works.
   Unfortunately, this required us to rename xdump sect field terr to
   terr0.  Sorry about that.
 * Fix bomb not to let you bomb dead ships and land units.
 * Make the retreat command a bit more helpful on retreat conditions,
   and make it fail on bad conditions.
 * Fix the mapper scripts.  Broken in 4.2.0.
 * Fix flying commands not to let planes do double duty as escorts.
   Broken in 4.3.12.
 * When a minesweeper hit a mine after sweeping, the mine wasn't used
   up.  If it sank the minesweeper, the code accessed freed memory,
   which could clobber the ship file or worse.  Broken in 4.0.17.
 * Don't let non-light units board ships that can't carry them.
 * Capitals can now employ up to 1000 civilians instead of 999.
 * Spy command changes:
   - Spy now requires sector military.  Before, presence of land units
     was sufficient, but spies shot were only deduced from sector
     military.  If you lost more spies than you had sector military,
     the rest came back from the dead.
   - Spy no longer ignores non-sea sectors without civilians, military
     and land units.
   - Remove columns lnd, pln from spy report.  The values didn't match
     the reported land units and planes, and could leak the presence
     of spy units.
   - Establish contact when spy succeeds even though the spy was
     caught.
 * Fix news reporting and damage when land units interdict ships in
   sectors other than sea.
 * Fix land unit return fire damage to ships to take accuracy into
   account, like the fire command and interdiction does.
 * Remove the inconsistent shelling damage reduction for range.  Fire
   command got damage reduced by 10-20% with a chance depending on
   range ("Wind deflects shells").  Ships interdicting got it reduced
   by half.  Other ways to shell did not get damage reduced for range.
 * Fix ground combat to report defending land units.  Broken in 4.3.4.
 * Info file and documentation fixes and improvements.

Changes to Empire 4.3.15 - Sun May 18 08:59:30 UTC 2008
 * The edit command keys deprecated in 4.3.10 are now gone.
 * fairland now obeys game file locks.
 * Do not leak world creation time in files utility, because that
   facilitates attacks against fairland's PRNG.  Broken in 4.3.12.
 * Fix starvation not to starve one more than it should.  The last man
   on a boat or land unit now can't starve anymore.
 * Fix a crash bug in satellite.  Broken in 4.2.7 and not fixed
   correctly in 4.2.12.
 * Fix a coordinate normalization bug that could theoretically lead to
   buffer overruns and other unpleasantness.  None have been
   reproduced, though.  Broken in 4.3.12.
 * Remove option FUEL.  The abstract idea of tying ships and land
   units to a logistical tether is sound, the concrete implementation
   as option FUEL is flawed.  It adds too much busy-work to the game
   to be enjoyable.  It hasn't been enabled in a public game for
   years.  The code implementing it is ugly, repetitive, and a burden
   to maintain.  The edit command still accepts and ignores the fuel
   keys for compatibility, but they are deprecated.
 * Fix pin-bomb not to report subs when there are none.
 * You now have to take a capital to capture the victim's money, loans
   or market lots.  Merely obliterating the capital doesn't cut it.
   It still makes the victim lose money, though.
 * Fix a bug that could theoretically allow sacking of non-existant
   capitals of visitors, deities and such.
 * You now gain BTUs and MOB_ACCESS mobility before the first update
   again.  You didn't since 4.3.10 introduced the ETU clock.
 * Fix edit to detect when the edited object changes while it's being
   edited.
 * Fix xdump nat for relations: it got HIDDEN backwards.  Broken in
   4.3.12.
 * Fix origin command not to prompt twice for its argument.  Broken in
   4.3.0.
 * Info file improvements.

Changes to Empire 4.3.14 - Mon May  5 04:57:03 UTC 2008
 * Another round of fixes to the fire command:
   - Don't disclose where the target retreated to.
   - Charge the target shells for returning fire.
   - Always use guns when the target is out of range, even if it's a
     submarine.  Before, the difference in shell use disclosed whether
     the target is a submarine.  Loophole opened in 4.3.12.
   - Make depth charges again work with just one shell.  Failing the
     command in that case lets players find out whether the target is
     a submarine.  Loophole opened in 4.3.12.
   - Detect when the firing sector, ship or land unit changes across
     the target prompt.  Can be abused to duplicate commodities, and
     more.
 * Fix parsing of anchor-relative time in update schedule.  Broken in
   4.3.13.
 * Fix logging of player input in the journal to include command
   interruption and EOF.
 * Fix oversights in 4.3.12's change to keep track of flying planes:
   planes could be erroneously reported damaged by their own ground
   strikes.  Happened with missions and the launch command.
 * Fix load not load hardened missiles.
 * Fix harden not to harden missiles loaded on land units.
 * New server option -E to choose what to do on recoverable internal
   error.  You can now make the server dump core and keep going (not
   implemented for Windows).  New econfig key post_crash_dump_hook to
   run a program after crash-dumping.  See scripts/savecore for an
   example.
 * Journal entries are now flushed to disk right away even when the
   server is not running in debug mode.
 * Don't let land units load trains.
 * Allow deity to display power report for all types of countries,
   with power c.
 * Fix designate's check for disallowed sector types.  Broken in
   4.3.12.
 * Documentation fixes.

Changes to Empire 4.3.13 - Tue Apr 15 19:03:11 UTC 2008
 * Work around strptime() lossage on some systems.  Fixes the parsing
   of the schedule file there.
 * New selector maxnoc for xdump version.
 * Fix initialization of realms in newcap.  Broken in 4.3.12.
 * Fix add for status arguments active, god, delete.  Broken in
   4.3.12.
 * Info file, manual page and documentation fixes.

Changes to Empire 4.3.12 - Wed Apr  2 05:35:06 UTC 2008
 * Fix rounding error in update that could result in more babies than
   food permits, and negative food.
 * Fix a bug that could lead to unfair thread scheduling under
   Windows.
 * Fix ship and land unit missile interdiction and ballistic missile
   interception to require a proper base.  Before, missiles could
   launch from anywhere for that.
 * Launch bug fixes:
   - Don't allow launching from unowned sectors.
   - Don't destroy missiles stuck on foreign ships.
   - Use up the supplies required for launching an asat only when it
     actually launches.
   - Don't ignore satellites' fuel use.
 * Deity command newcap now requires its second argument (sanctuary
   coordinates).  Before, it tried to pick a suitable location when
   none was given.  The code implementing this feature had problems,
   and it's not worth fixing, because it is obscure, and rarely (if
   ever) used: no conscientious deity would use it for a real game,
   and for blitzes fairland does a better job.
 * Keep track of flying planes properly.  This fixes a number of bugs:
   - While the bomb command awaited pin-bombing target input from the
     player, other players could interact with the pin-bombers and
     escorts as if they were sitting in their bases: spy them, damage,
     capture, load, unload, or upgrade them, even get intercepted by
     them.  But any changes to those planes were wiped out when they
     landed.  Abusable.
   - The bomb command could bomb its own escorts, directly (pin-bomb
     planes) or through collateral damage, strategic sector damage,
     collapsing bridges or nuke damage.  The damage to the escorts was
     wiped out when they landed.
   - If you asked for a plane to fly both in the primary mission and
     escort, you got charged fuel for two sorties instead of one.
 * Plug memory leaks in plane interception.
 * Fix trade not to let the buyer teleport satellites (not in orbit)
   and asats to an arbitrary sector.  Abusable, because abms
   intercepted from anywhere, and satellites could be launched from
   unowned sectors.
 * The PRNG seed is now logged in the journal.
 * Fix nightly build for Windows.
 * Fix crash bug that bit when custom tables contained columns names
   that existed, but weren't supposed to be in the custom table.
 * New timestamp selector for commodity, country, game, loan, nation,
   news, realm, trade, treaty to support incremental xdump.
 * Deity commands newcap and add wipe the nation more thoroughly.  add
   no longer touches relations and flags for status active and god.
 * New utility program empdump to export and import game state as
   plain text.  Check its manual for details, including limitations.
 * Plane, ship and land unit stats are no longer stored as game state,
   but recomputed from tech and base stats as needed.
 * xdump ver is no longer a special case.  Syntax "xdump ver" is now
   deprecated.  Use "xdump version *".
 * Fire and torpedo cleanup and bug hunt:
   - Plug memory leak in fire command.
   - Fix ammunition use when returning fire: resupply could lose
     shells when returning fire to multiple targets, and land units
     were charged per target instead of just once.
   - Interdicting land units now resupply shells automatically, for
     consistency with other ways to fire.
   - torpedo and fire no longer resupply shells automatically.  The
     latter used to resupply land units only.
   - Land units no longer have to be in supply to fire actively, for
     consistency with other ways to fire.
   - Submarines with zero mobility can no longer interdict, for
     consistency with other ways to torpedo.
   - Fix bugs that let submarines without capability torp use
     torpedoes to return fire and interdict.
   - Fix torpedo command not to require a line of sight for return
     fire and depth charges, and to use torpedo range instead of
     firing range for return torpedoes.
   - Active fire and interdiction didn't work for ships with zero
     firing range, even though return fire and support did.  No such
     ships exist in the stock game.
   - Let land units with zero firing range and non-zero firing damage
     fire, for consistency with ships.  No such units exist in the
     stock game.
   - Ships required different numbers of military to operate their
     guns for the various kinds of fire.  Unify to require 2*N-1
     military to fire N guns.
   - Ship ammunition use differed for the various kinds of fire.
     Unify to use one shell per two guns.
   - Forts could fire support even when there were not enough mil.
   - Fix automatic shell resupply in several places to supply exactly
     the shells actually fired, no more, no less.
 * Change depth charges back to how they are documented and worked
   before 4.0.6, mostly: require no guns, one military, do damage like
   shell fire from three guns (before 4.0.6: two guns), use two
   shells.  In 4.0.6's model, they worked exactly like shell fire
   (require guns and gun crew, non-zero firing range, damage and
   ammunition use scales with available guns), except for missions,
   which was a bug.  Note that depth charge damage for all ships is
   now like fire from three guns for two shells.  No change for dd; af
   did two gun damage for one shell before, and nas did four gun
   damage for two shells.
 * The edit command keys deprecated in 4.3.3 are now gone.
 * Fix build not to screw up automatic dependencies on certain compile
   errors.
 * Fix a bug that could prevent repeated news from properly
   aggregating into one news item.
 * Properly initialize all bits in game state files, even those that
   aren't used.
 * Fix explore's test for stopping on a splashed bridge.  The bug made
   explore print to a bogus message.
 * Fix spelling of symbol airburst in table plane-flags.  This could
   affect clients.
 * Change designate not to check total cost before executing the
   redesignation.  The code implementing that was buggy and too ugly
   to live.  Designate doesn't cost anything in the stock game.
 * Always charge land units at least as much mobility for assaulting
   from non-landing ships as from landing ships.  Before, marines lost
   all mobility when assaulting from a non-landing ship, which could
   be less than what the same assault costs from a landing ship (half
   an update's worth).
 * Fix LWP's stack initialization for -s.  It caused crashes on some
   systems.
 * Fix confused and buggy bridge splashing code:
   - Flying planes could be reported drowned.
   - Pin-bombing a bridge head failed to collapse bridge spans for
     lack of support, unless the pin-bombing caused collateral damage.
   - Corrupt sector file could lead to infinite recursion.
 * Relative names now work for econfig keys data and info.
 * Fix utility programs to abort on internal errors.  They used to
   print a message and attempt to recover.
 * Fix off-by-one in fairland that ate the last expansion island.
 * Switch from CVS to git.
 * Code refactoring and cleanup.
 * Portability fixes.
 * Info file, manual page and documentation fixes and updates.

Changes to Empire 4.3.11 - Tue Jan  1 18:57:38 UTC 2008
 * New sector selector elev.  It's set by fairland, but has no effect
   on the game.  It can be useful for deities to customize a world
   created by fairland.
 * The client now copes with ids greater than 15.  The Empire
   protocol currently uses 14 ids.
 * Rewrite the client's code for reading server output during login.
   The old code could write one byte beyond the end of the buffer
   (theoretically a remote hole), got confused by long lines, and
   lines that didn't arrive in one piece.
 * Long country name, password or user name crashed the client.
 * Fix xdump not to deny access to game state tables when maximum
   minutes per day are exceeded.
 * The server considers a country bankrupt when its treasury is
   negative.  Except when it doesn't.  Fix that:
   - report misreported countries with $0 as broke.
   - If a command spent a few cents more than you had, commands requiring
     money became unavailable even when rounding brought you back to
     $0.  But logging out and back in then bankrupted you.
   - If your treasury rose to exactly $0, commands requiring money
     remained unavailable.
   - If you had $0, sectors didn't build and sectors and ships didn't
     produce at the update.
 * Fix a bug in trade that made your money evaporate when a trade fell
   through because you couldn't fully pay.  This bug was there since
   the introduction of the market in 4.0.0.  It got aggravated by the
   removal of forced loans in 4.3.0.
 * Fix printing of the new group in army, fleet and wing.  Broken in
   4.3.5.
 * Fix flash not to screw up the message when the first argument
   contains white-space.
 * Don't let planes intercept when they are stuck in foreign bases, on
   inefficient ships or land units, or on land units loaded on ships
   or land units.
 * Fix a bug that made interception require petrol to be present even
   for planes that don't use fuel (SAMs).  Broken in 4.3.3.  Air
   defense missions weren't affected.
 * fairland and setsector now limit fertility to 100 instead of 120,
   like the other resources.
 * Generalize the autonav hack for fishing boats so it covers oil
   derricks as well.
 * Fix bug in path command that made it swallow every other step.
   Broken in 4.2.22.
 * The execute command no longer supports redirections and execute in
   batch files.  Flaws in the Empire protocol make it next to
   impossible for clients to implement that correctly.  See
   doc/clients-howto for an explanation.
 * Rewrite much of the client's code for sending commands and
   receiving server output:
   - No longer blocks on sending commands, which could deadlock the
     session.
   - Fix race condition that could cause server output to be discarded
     on EOF on standard input.
   - Don't discard server output when reading standard input fails.
   - Fix error handling for execute and other, more obscure cases.
   - More rigorous error checking for redirections and execute.
     Clearer error messages, too.
   - Fix execute redirected to file or pipe.  Believed to be broken in
     4.2.0.
   - The client now creates files for redirections with the same
     permissions whether the redirection is in a pipe or not.  Before,
     redirections without a pipe created files with no permissions for
     group and others.  This change may make your redirected output
     visible to other users on your system.  Use the usual controls,
     like umask, to restrict permissions to your liking.
   - Reject unexpected redirections (violating the protocol).  Before,
     they silently replaced the current one, and in the case of pipes
     leaked file descriptors and memory.
   - Redirections in batch files are not implemented.  They didn't
     quite work before, and could leak memory and file descriptors.  A
     flaw in the Empire protocol makes them next to impossible to
     implement correctly.
   - The execute command in batch files is not implemented.  A flaw in
     the Empire protocol makes this practically useless anyway.
   - Old code leaked memory in various places.
   - Unfortunate incompatibility with older servers: if you type the
     EOF character (normally ^D) at an argument prompt, the session
     hangs.  Use the interrupt character (normally ^C) to get out.
 * The client now supports options -h and -v.
 * The client no longer zaps its command line in a lame attempt at
   protecting users who foolishly specify passwords on the command
   line.  Zapping annoys system administrators and creates a false
   sense of security.
 * Journal entries are now flushed to disk right away when the server
   is running in debug mode.
 * Fix bugs in load that could make loading operations fail noisily
   instead of silently on some systems.
 * Server now reliably shuts down session when it receives an
   end-of-file condition from the client.  Before, it merely failed
   the current command when it got it at an argument prompt.
 * Fix bug in execute that could crash the server on some systems when
   it prompts for the argument.
 * Fix bug that let you check whether a non-allied carrier is
   efficient enough for takeoff when one of your planes got stuck
   there somehow.
 * Fix bug that let you attempt to escort a one-way mission to a
   carrier with non-light, non-interceptor escorts.  Such planes don't
   fit on carriers, and the command then failed with a bogus error
   message.  Before 4.2.17, the planes flew, and the escorts were
   teleported home.
 * Change the rules for fitting planes on ships slightly, so that the
   order of loading no longer matters. Choppers and x-lights can now
   use plane slots even when not light.  X-light choppers, which don't
   exist in the stock game, can no longer use x-light slots.
 * The server now keeps its log file open, just like the journal.
 * New server option -R to set the PRNG seed.  This is for
   reproducible tests.  Change the Windows-only service uninstall
   options from -r/-R to -u/-U.
 * Supply a real PRNG for Windows instead of the leaky water-pistol
   Windows provides.
 * Threads sleeping until a specified time could return early under
   Windows.  This could cause missed updates.  Broken in 4.3.10.
 * Fix missing newline in show updates.
 * Power report didn't factor tech into power correctly.  Broken in
   4.3.3.
 * Code refactoring and cleanup.
 * Info file and documentation fixes and updates.

Changes to Empire 4.3.10 - Thu Sep  6 17:59:53 UTC 2007
 * Bridge spans now cost $1000 instead of $2000, and bridge towers
   $3000 instead of $7500.
 * The Windows port now supports IPv6, but it still needs to be
   enabled manually at compile-time.
 * The custom table reader detects more errors.
 * Do not leak world creation time in files and fairland, because
   that facilitates attacks against the PRNG.  This misfeature crept
   into 4.3.0.
 * Remove the ancient, crufty non-UCONTEXT system-dependent LWP code.
   Using it required manual hackery since 4.3.0.
 * Plug file descriptor leak in add command.
 * Don't kill player connections violently when their thread appears
   to be hung.  Threads being aborted by update or shutdown could be
   misidentified as hung, and the violence could lead to resource
   leaks, locked out updates, and corrupted game state.
 * Fix LWP to reliably wake up threads sleeping for a time.  Before,
   players with a sufficiently fast connection could starve out system
   threads, including the update.
 * Fix a class of bugs that made commands behave differently while the
   update is attempting to take control:
   - No MOB_ACCESS mobility was gained.
   - Telegrams were miscounted.
   - Bulletins got misfiled as production reports.
   - The navigate command ignored sail paths.
   - The declare command was more quiet, and declarations of war
     failed silently when SLOW_WAR was enabled.
   - Many messages got misdirected to bulletins.
   Some of these bugs go back all the way to Empire 2, ca 1995.
 * New deity command reload, effect similar to SIGHUP.
 * Not voting for a demand update no longer lets you veto further
   demand updates.  This feature was flawed (it encourages players to
   vote late so that they can tactically vote no and thus build up
   veto rights), virtually unused, and buggy.  The edit command still
   accepts and ignores the country key 'U' for compatibility, but it
   is deprecated.
 * Fix zdone not to claim to have triggered an update when they're
   disabled.
 * New update scheduler and ETU clock:
   - New schedule file.  See doc/schedule for how to use it.  Replaces
     econfig keys update_policy, adj_update, update_times, hourslop,
     blitz_time.  A change of schedule does not require a server
     restart.
   - The force command can no longer force updates in the future.
     Edit the schedule file for that.
   - New command show updates to show the update schedule.  Obsoletes
     the update command.
   - New xdump game and xdump updates.
   - New utility program empsched to help test update schedules.
   - Replace option DEMANDUPDATE and econfig key update_demandpolicy
     by econfig key update_demand.
   - econfig key update_demandtimes no longer applies to scheduled
     demand updates.
   - You now receive new BTUs at the update in addition to login.
   - You now always gain the same BTUs and MOB_ACCESS mobility per
     turn, even when the update schedule changes, updates get missed,
     or unscheduled demand updates run.
   - Remove the mobupdate command, because porting it to the new ETU
     clock is not worth it.
 * Redesign of synchronization between commands, update and shutdown,
   and how updates are triggered:
   - Simplify update to a single thread waiting for the trigger.
     Before, three update threads had to perform a carefully
     choreographed dance to make updates happen.  The dance relied on
     thread priorities for correctness, which are only implemented by
     LWP.  With pthreads and under Windows, demand updates were prone
     to two update threads starting up concurrently.  Even with LWP,
     forced and demand updates could lead to double updates.
   - Use a lock for synchronization: commands take it shared, update
     and shutdown take it exclusive.  This makes update and shutdown
     block until all aborted commands terminated and gave up their
     lock.  Before, they proceeded blindly after waiting two or one
     seconds respectively, which was cheesy and unsafe.
   - New commands no longer fail while the update is pending, they are
     delayed until after the update.
   - New commands can no longer start during shutdown.  Before, they
     could, but risked getting killed violently, possibly corrupting
     game state.
   - Fix command execution so that commands blocked in writing
     redirections are abortable.  The bug allowed players to delay
     update and shutdown indefinitely.
   - Fix shutdown not to let player threads block on output.  This
     let players delay shutdown indefinitely.
   - Fix reading of player input not to block again after update or
     shutdown aborted it.  The bug allowed players to delay update and
     shutdown indefinitely.
 * Thread priorities are only implemented by LWP and no longer used.
   With LWP, they let players with a sufficiently fast connection
   starve out the threads that clean the lost file and kill idle
   connections.  Drop them.
 * Show nuke rounded required research incorrectly.
 * Log unprintable characters as octal escapes rather than question
   marks in the journal file.
 * The files program no longer changes permissions of existing files.
 * The files program now creates all files with permissions ug=rw and
   all directories ug=rwx, modified by umask.
 * Fix a bug that could make arm, disarm and nuke detonation work with
   a used-up nuke instead of the armed one.  This could be abused to
   detonate nukes multiple times.  Broken in 4.3.3.
 * Fix nuke detonation output for zero blast radius.
 * Plug memory leaks in thread code.
 * Fix a bug that made LWP I/O wakeup unreliable.
 * New march sub-command v for view.
 * Journal was initialized before threads were, which was wrong.
 * Fix server not to create a journal on SIGHUP when it is disabled.
 * shutdown 0 now requests immediate shutdown instead of cancellation
   of a pending shutdown.  shutdown -1 now cancels.
 * flash and wall no longer split long message lines.
 * Fix a bug in collect that screwed up a fully collected loan instead
   of deleting it.  The screwed up loan could not be sharked or
   collected, but it could be repaid.
 * Remove the wait command, it's been broken and restricted to deity
   since Empire 2, ca. 1995.
 * Budget failed to take sector production into account for predicting
   unit repairs.  Before 4.3.6, this bug bit only when you fooled
   around with budget priorities.
 * When unit repairs are limited by materials, the efficiency gain is
   now rounded down.
 * Ship repairs outside harbors and plane repairs by carriers used to
   consume commodities when and as far as available.  Now, they
   consume the same fraction of the real cost of each commodity,
   i.e. commodity use is limited by the most scarce commodity.
   Neither old nor new behavior make much sense, but the new code is
   simpler.
 * Code refactoring and cleanup, in particular to make the Windows
   port less ugly.
 * Portability fixes.
 * Info file and manual page updates.  All manual pages are now
   installed in section 6.

Changes to Empire 4.3.9 - Sat Jan  6 12:42:19 UTC 2007
 * Fix declare to prevent the deity from changing relations for a
   player to self.  Allow the deity to set the relations of a player
   towards the deity.
 * Fix arm not to put the same nuke on multiple planes (broken in
   4.3.3).
 * New option AUTO_POWER.
 * Sectors now repair allied land units.
 * Sectors now repair only own and allied planes.
 * Fix repair of planes on foreign carriers: repair allied planes,
   ignore the others.  Before 4.3.3, carriers destroyed rather than
   repaired foreign planes.  Since 4.3.3, foreign planes were treated
   as recoverable error.
 * Fix automatic fortification of land units to use all excess
   mobility even when mobility delta exceeds mobility maximum.
 * Disable automatic fortification of land units when MOB_ACCESS is
   on, because it is prohibitively slow then (broken in 4.2.13).
 * Budget now shows level production (tech, education, research and
   happiness) rounded instead of randomly rounded.
 * Fix update not to randomly flush small level production to zero.
 * Fix overly restrictive game file locking under Windows (broken in
   4.3.8).
 * Fix navigate to charge mobility for sweeping mines without moving
   (broken in 4.3.6).
 * Code cleanup.

Changes to Empire 4.3.8 - Fri Oct 20 18:30:28 UTC 2006
 * Ships no longer produce stuff when the government is broke.
 * Fix land unit casualties in revolts.
 * Fix security units not to raid friendly che.
 * Fix update sequence to ensure stopped sectors don't work on the
   ships, planes and land units in the sector.  Before 4.3.6, this bug
   bit only when you fooled around with budget priorities.
 * Fix canal loading (was broken in 4.3.0).
 * Fix tend not to tend land units that could not be loaded.
 * Make xdump command available before break, but deny access to game
   state.
 * Lock game files to prevent concurrent access by multiple programs.
   fairland does not yet obey the lock.
 * Fix production to consider sector item limit.
 * Fix swapsector to update coastal flag correctly (broken in 4.3.0).
 * Enhanced mapping sub-commands in move, test, explore and transport.
 * Code cleanup.
 * Info file fixes.

Changes to Empire 4.3.7 - Fri Jul 14 23:05:19 UTC 2006
 * Sanctuaries are again fully populated with civilians (4.3.6 changed
   the limit, but not the population).  Food is now spread evenly
   among them.
 * Fix path finder to find shortest naval and aerial paths again
   (broken in 4.3.4).
 * transport's map sub-command now does the right thing for a unit
   number argument.
 * Fix bug in map sub-command of move, explore and transport that
   passed junk to map command.  Could theoretically crash.
 * Food need reported by starvation was one short for sectors without
   food.
 * Change land unit ammunition use back to what it was before 4.2.3.
   This lets deities customize ammunition use independent of damage.
   It also substantially reduces ammunition consumption at high tech.
 * navigation and march enhancements:
   - Sub-command 'f' now takes an optional ship / land unit number.
   - Mapping sub-commands now take an optional ship / land unit
     number.
   - New sub-command 'd' to drop mines.
 * Let minesweepers retreat at their full speed (missed in 4.3.6).
 * SUPER_BARS cannot be harmed, so don't interdict them.
 * Don't let trains and non-trains march together for now, because the
   march code isn't prepared for that.
 * New mapping flag 'n' to show nukes.
 * Mapping flag '*' now shows nukes as well.
 * New command nbmap to bmap around a nuke.  Overload command nmap to
   map around a nuke when given a nuke argument.
 * Fix an inconsistency that gave tactical bombers a small bonus
   vs. flak when pin-bombing.
 * Fix production to show the designation that actually produces, not
   the designation as it is now (broken in 4.3.6).
 * Fix accidental whitespace change in output of sdump, pdump and
   ldump that crept into 4.3.5.
 * Support user-defined sector types and products in custom tables,
   not just customization of existing ones.
 * Fix off-by-one bug in budget that used to be masked by budget
   priorities until their demise in 4.3.6.  The bug could crash the
   game on certain systems.
 * Code cleanup.
 * Info file fixes.

Changes to Empire 4.3.6 - Tue Jun 20 18:46:18 UTC 2006
 * The shutdown command now terminates the server process correctly
   even with LinuxThreads pthreads under Linux 2.4 and earlier.
 * Cope with old versions of groff (broken in 4.3.0).
 * You can now arm allied planes with nukes.
 * Taking a nuke off a plane gives it to the sector owner again.
   Feature was accidentally dropped in 4.3.3.  Recipient must be
   allied.
 * Naval path went bananas for impassable end sectors (broken in
   4.3.1).
 * New econfig key disabled_commands.
 * New territory selector dterr, restricted to deities.  The territory
   command defaults to it for deities.
 * Let land units attack as long as they have positive mobility,
   except for high-mobility terrain (mountains), where the rules
   remain as they were: land units need to have all the mobility
   charged for the attack, not counting combat and moving in to
   occupy.  Rationale: Making sure your land units reach attack
   positions with enough mobility left is a pain in the neck.
   Requiring only positive mobility is friendlier, but allowed rushing
   of mountains, so we make an exception there.
 * Can typeset info pages as PostScript.  Result isn't exactly pretty.
 * Support disabling of infrastructure in infra custom table.  Remove
   redundant option DEFENSE_INFRA.  show command now shows only enabled
   infrastructure.
 * Fix crash on empty argument in bmap, lbmap, lmap, map, nmap, pbmap,
   pmap sbmap, smap (broken in 4.3.1).
 * New, simpler sector mobility cost formula:
   - The basic cost is still a linear function of sector efficiency,
     with customizable cost at 0% and at 100%.  The latter used to be
     derived from the former.  The show command shows both parameters
     now.
   - Mountains are no longer a special case.
   - Tweak costs: mountains now range from 2.4 to 1.2 instead of 2.174
     to 1.304, highway, bridge head, bridge span and bridge tower
     range from 0.4 to 0.001 instead of 0.2 to 0.001, and wilderness
     is 0.4 flat instead of 0.6 to 0.4.  All sector types mortal
     players can designate now cost the same at 0%.  That's a feature.
   - Road infrastructure now reduces cost up to 90%, linear in road
     efficiency (used to be close to that, but non-linear).  Same for
     rail infrastructure, but 99%.  Adapted from Ice World V.
   - Double land unit minimum cost to 0.02, to slow them down on
     highways.
   - Change land unit cost penalty in newly taken land to an extra 0.2
     instead of a minimum of 0.2, to reduce penetration depth.
 * Reduce bridge head defense and collect value to match highway's.
 * sinfrastructure displayed bogus rail mobility costs when there was
   no rail.
 * Retreating engineers took full landmine damage instead of half.
 * Fix socket creation code not to print a null pointer.
 * Fix login option code not to search beyond end of table (broken in
   4.2.21).
 * Spy planes and satellites can no longer spot landspies.
 * Spy planes can now spot surface ships at sea.  They can no longer
   spot land units loaded on ships or land units.
 * Fix train retreat mobility cost, and don't permit retreat off rail.
 * Change maximum population to 100 for plains (was 49), mountains
   (was 99), bridge spans and bridge towers (was 999), and to 1000 for
   the other habitable sector types (was 999).
 * Let minesweepers navigate at the speed their stats indicate by
   letting them sweep on the move at no extra mobility charge.
 * Reduce chance for planes to abort from 100-eff (if eff<80) to
   80-eff.  This should make it easier to punch through air defense,
   flak in particular, and increase the risk of getting shot down.
 * Ship and land unit flak intensity is now proportional to efficiency.
 * Ship and land unit flak intensity is no longer scaled by the tech
   of the owner of the last thing firing.  It's still scaled by each
   thing's tech.
 * All ships and land units firing flak now spot the plane and are
   spotted by the plane.  Previously, spotting stopped as soon as flak
   maxed out.
 * Inefficient land units were overcharged mobility when reacting.
   Broken when Empire3 changed land unit mobility use not to depend on
   efficiency, except for supply units.
 * New journal file to log complete player input plus selected
   important events.  Controlled by new econfig key keep_journal, off
   by default.
 * Fix unsafe shutdown on SIGINT and SIGTERM.
 * Fix land unit path finding: paths weren't always cheapest (broken
   in 4.0.2), and trains could be sent down paths without rail (never
   worked).  Also fixes unit reaction path cost.
 * The custom table reader can now deal with sector, item, product and
   infra tables more comfortably.
 * Remove option BIG_CITY.  Deities can customize the sect table to
   get the same effect.
 * Many more selectors can now be compared with names, not just
   numbers.  This includes nations, e.g. census ?old=Mirkwood.  Does
   not fully work for queer names like &&&.
 * Let land units on missions support, just like ships.
 * Don't let units loaded on a train react.
 * Change update sequence to repair ships, planes and land units after
   sectors produce.  This makes repairs use new avail instead of old.
 * Let players stop and start units.
 * Remove budget priorities.
 * Make plane report easier to understand.
 * Change land report to show carriers in the same format as plane and
   nuke report do.
 * Code cleanup.
 * Info file and manual page fixes.

Changes to Empire 4.3.5 - Sun May 28 07:49:54 UTC 2006
 * In conditionals, ~ compared to a string selector now stands for an
   empty string.
 * Change encoding of `not in any group' from " " to "".  This makes
   fleet=~ work.  It also affects xdump.
 * Fix plane capture code to clear wing.
 * People now eat and starve exactly the same in sectors, ships and
   land units.  There used to be small differences, and civilians and
   uw loaded on land units didn't eat at all.  The starvation command
   has been updated accordingly.
 * Fix bug that makes it impossible to assault or board with land
   units (broken in 4.3.4).
 * Code cleanup.

Changes to Empire 4.3.4 - Thu May 25 05:46:10 UTC 2006
 * Don't use non-portable groff features (broken in 4.3.0).
 * Work around potential crash bugs in command argument access.
 * Plug major information leak through nation selectors (broken in
   4.2.21).  The fix unfortunately exchanges the meaning of xdump
   nation and xdump country.  Sorry about that.
 * Minimize redundancy between (mortal's) xdump nation and xdump
   country.
 * New nation selector rejects.
 * xdump nation now shows foreign relations and no longer discloses
   hidden relations.
 * Fix crash bug in edit.
 * Fix number of planes building in budget command (broken in 4.3.3).
 * Selectors group, fleet, wing and army are now strings, and obvious
   syntax like fleet#a works.  xdump also shows the strings now.
   Units not assigned to a group currently have group string " ", but
   that may still change.
 * Don't fold conditionals to lower case, because it breaks valid
   conditionals like fleet#A.
 * Mobility cost of a plane sortie is no longer limited to current
   mobility + 32.
 * Various formulas no longer truncate or round intermediate results.
 * Interdiction mission charged twice the normal mobility cost for
   torpedoes.
 * Fix sail not to interpret negative x-coordinates as unsail
   argument.
 * Improved configure script.
 * Code cleanup.

Changes to Empire 4.3.3 - Tue May 16 21:35:47 UTC 2006
 * power c can now show powerless countries.  power c * works.
 * Fortresses now require 5% efficiency to return fire and interdict.
 * Range of ship return fire and support fire no longer depends on
   efficiency.
 * Fix heap smash in login command client.  Remote hole!
 * Properly destroy nukes on collapsing bridges.  Before, you could
   rescue them by building a new bridge or arming them on naval
   planes.
 * Nukes are now numbered like other units:
   - New selector type replaces selectors number and types.
   - New selector plane points to plane armed with this nuke.
   - New selectors effic, mobil, tech, group, opx, opy, mission,
     radius.  Provided because all units have them; values are
     currently not interesting.
   - nuke command output redesigned.
   - ndump output changed subtly: nukes are no longer sorted by
     location, nukes in the same location no longer share id, and
     nukes on planes are shown.
   - transport nuke now works like transport plane.
 * arm and disarm now accept the common plane syntax, not just plane
   numbers.
 * Fix arm to let you change an armed plane's air-burst/ground-burst
   (broken in 4.2.6).
 * territory no longer re-prompts when supplied with a bad argument,
   it just fails.
 * edit lets you edit stuff that is actually computed from other
   state, like sector's coastal flag.  This makes no sense and is now
   deprecated.  Stuff deprecated since 4.2.15 is now gone.
 * Code cleanup.

Changes to Empire 4.3.2 - Thu Apr 27 17:59:58 UTC 2006
 * Fix security units' raid at the update (broken in 4.0.0, fixed only
   for 100% units in 4.2.7).  Back out 4.2.7's 2.5x deadliness
   increase.  Make sure empty units don't kill anyone.
 * Fix bug in player_init(), which was most likely fatal on 64 bit
   hosts.  Broken in 4.3.0.
 * Fix xdump not to disclose other countries' realms (new in 4.3.0).
 * The order in which sectors were visited for `*' arguments disclosed
   the real origin, fix.  Mapping commands used to work around this
   bug, until 4.3.1 exposed it there as well.
 * Code didn't compile on some systems.
 * Fix edit plane not to truncate large values for keys 'a' and 'd'.

Changes to Empire 4.3.1 - Sat Apr 15 11:40:47 UTC 2006
 * Fix check of game state on server startup (new in 4.3.0).
 * sail now accepts a destination sector.
 * Tend could send bogus bulletins (broken in 4.3.0).
 * Plug memory leaks in mission command.
 * Close loophole in navigate that allowed players to find all sectors
   that are unfriendly or inefficient harbors or bridges.
 * Server didn't start when default econfig was missing and user
   didn't supply one with -e (broken in 4.3.0).
 * Retreat condition 'h' (helpless) never worked, fix.
 * Fix retreating mine sweepers to use mobility for sweeping.
 * Fix retreating land units to hit mines with the same probability
   and to take the same damage as in normal movement.  Before,
   hit probability was higher, and damage was lower.
 * Ships could retreat into sectors owned by whoever made them
   retreat, but not in their owner's sectors.
 * Fix 'm' at the movement prompt of transport and test.
 * Fix march and test not to apply conditionals to sectors mapped,
   which led to spurious error messages.
 * Fix break not to respect conditionals.  The bug let players keep
   sanctuaries.
 * Fix retreat code not to respect conditionals.  Attackers could
   abuse this to suppress fleet and army retreat orders.
 * Fix retreat and edit to zero-terminate retreat paths.
   Theoretically abusable for gaining information.
 * Fix format string crash bugs in load, spy and bomb.
 * Fix the telegram editor: empty telegrams were broken in 4.2.21, and
   ~p before the first line of text never worked.
 * Fix ancient bridge building race condition that could break the
   test whether the player can afford the bridge.
 * Fix trade lot change detection in set command.  Can probably be
   abused to defraud sellers.
 * The pthread code now compiles under Solaris.
 * navigate and march now permit any whitespace between route and
   optional argument for radar, lookout, sonar, not just spaces.
 * Fix canal navigation (was broken in 4.3.0).
 * Info file fixes.

Changes to Empire 4.3.0 - Sun Mar 19 08:13:10 UTC 2006
 * version no longer pretends option SHIPNAMES still exists.
 * Remove files auth and ban.  They could be used to restrict client
   address and user.  Restricting user is useless, because players can
   send whatever they want.  Banning IPs is better done with a packet
   filter.  That leaves restricting deity IPs.  Provide new econfig
   key privip for that.  Apply it to session kill as well as login.
 * xdump escapes GUINEA_PIGS status:
   - xdump is now enabled unconditionally.
   - xdump sect now dumps selector coastal, because it can't be
     reliably computed from other xdump information.
   - New xdump realm and country.  Realm information is now stored in
     a separate file, with appropriate selectors.
   - Reviewed for completeness and information leaks.  See info xdump
     for remaining issues.  New treaty selector uid, nat selectors
     relations, contacts.  Removed useless selectors: news and lost
     uid, nat dayno.
   - Command syntax changed.
   - xdump opt is no more, option information is now in xdump ver.
   - xdump can now dump meta-data.
   - Header and footer changed to be more compact.  You now need
     meta-data to identify fields.
   - Bug fixes.
   - Documentation in doc/xdump.
 * New econfig key builtindir.
 * New econfig key custom_tables lets you customize configuration
   tables without recompiling.  Customizing tables other than unit
   tables is not recommended for now.  See doc/econfig for
   instructions.
 * Check configuration and game state are sane on server startup.
 * Remove option NONUKES and NEUTRON.  Deities can load a suitable
   nuke table to get the same effect.
 * Remove option DRNUKE.  Use econfig key drnuke_const to control
   whether nukes need research.
 * Disqualify land units from performing missions while loaded on
   ships or trains.
 * Fix dump for strings without terminating zero.
 * Fix login command option not to send an extra prompt.
 * zdone now displays information about demand update vetoing.
 * The Windows port now requires Winsock version 2.
 * Remove econfig key powe_cost.
 * version report now shows all the configurable settings of interest
   to players.
 * carg and lcarg now display people as well.
 * ldump now dumps civ and uw as well.
 * Fix dangling pointer dereference in dogfighting code.
 * Tell sector owner when partisans take over.  But don't disclose che
   casualties then.
 * emp_server, files, fairland now support options -h and -v.
 * Simplify baroque version numbering to a single version number.
   This affects output of version.
 * New show item and show news.
 * New build process:
   - Follow the usual steps: configure; make; make install.  The
     latter is optional.  The only file deities still have to edit is
     econfig.
   - Use GNU Autoconf for system configuration.
   - Use GNU Make for portability and features.
   - Support separate build trees.
   - Remake out-of-date dependencies automatically.
   - Remake out-of-date info files automatically.
   - Flatten info directory.
   - Formatted info files are no longer distributed in source tarball.
   - Use LWP only with UCONTEXT.  Autoconfiguring the other LWP
     low-level options doesn't seem to be worth the effort, as
     UCONTEXT should be pretty portable.
 * Fix use of freed memory in sail.
 * sail could let large ships enter big cities.
 * Fix reject and accept not to require contact.
 * Fix sharebmap and telegram to prompt for a missing first argument.
 * Fix report to align column research correctly for deities.
 * When the optional newspaper argument doesn't work because HIDDEN is
   enabled, complain instead of ignoring it silently.
 * When BLITZ is enabled, fairland no longer permutes country numbers
   in newcap_script so that start islands are ordered from top left to
   bottom right.
 * Minimize output format differences between options:
   - census shows column fall regardless of FALLOUT.
   - show nuke now shows column res regardless of DRNUKE.
   - report no longer suppress column status when HIDDEN is enabled.
     HIDDEN limits status information like for the country command.
   - relations column width differed depending on option SLOW_WAR.
     Always use the wider format.
 * Fix a bug in edit that suppressed the player notification telex on
   military reserve change.
 * Fix command dispatch not to let deities use commands that are
   declared not to be available to them.  The only command affected is
   break.
 * Fix the list command for visitor.
 * econfig key m_m_p_d no longer applies to deities.
 * Fix the origin command for country #0.  Allow moving origin to
   another country's origin.  Allow deities to reset origin to
   absolute 0,0.  This turns origin into a superset of the offset
   command.  Remove offset command.
 * Fix a bug that caused unpredictable flak damage when it should have
   been maximum damage (was broken in 4.2.19).
 * Don't store initial capital location, remove the associated nat
   selectors xstart, ystart.
 * Fix production command to consider resource depletion.
 * Fix justification of coordinate output in cutoff and mission.
 * Option UPDATESCHED is no longer optional.  Disabling it didn't
   work anyway.
 * Support IPv6.
 * Turn options into ordinary econfig keys.
 * New econfig key start_cash.
 * BTU regeneration now depends on the capital's work percentage.
 * nation now supports an optional argument that lets deities ask for
   somebody else's nation report.
 * Fix nation to display SANCTUARY instead of VISITOR for countries in
   sanctuary.
 * Fix capital to let you use a regained sacked capital without
   activating another one in between.
 * Don't move capital when it is sacked.
 * New ship capability canal, replacing obscure formula based on build
   materials.
 * You now need a capital to request a demand update.
 * power now ignores landspies.
 * Fix LWP stack checking.
 * Clean up LWP, drop dead machine-specific code, fix portability bugs
   in UCONTEXT code.
 * census now shows the old owner instead of `*'.  dump is unchanged
   to avoid breaking clients.
 * peek no longer prints the old owner.
 * When a bombed land unit retreated, collateral damage was applied to
   the wrong sector.
 * paradrop, drop and fly can no longer abandon the base sector.
 * Tending foreign ships now sends a bulletin to the owner.
 * Fix bug that permitted login for inactive countries, including ""
 * Fix tend for spies.
 * Change launch to fire all missiles selected at the same target.
   Previously, it prompted for a new target after each missile.
 * add, consider, build, launch and fire no longer re-prompt when
   supplied with a bad argument, they just fail.  Consequently, the
   build command no longer lets you list types you can build.  It
   points to the show command instead.
 * Fix add not to truncate country number.
 * Fix selector coastal to be accurate at all times.
 * Fix obscure bug in fairland: the sector added last to an island
   wasn't considered coastal.  Affected resource computation.
 * Fix sector wiping in add command.
 * Remove options NO_LCMS, NO_HCMS, NO_OIL.  They were broken in many
   ways.  Custom configuration tables should become a serviceable
   replacement eventually.
 * Client no longer freezes on long lines of server output.
 * Fix uninitialized signal mask bugs.
 * Fix Windows service code's treatment of -e.
 * Sub interdiction disclosed sub owner through news' actor selector.
 * country reports on all countries, but carefully limits information
   disclosed to mortals.  Output format changed.
 * Market no longer forces sellers to grant loans.
 * Fix potential crash bug in set command.  Friendlier prompt and
   diagnostics.
 * Substantial code cleanup and portability fixes.
 * Extend empfile abstraction to cover game configuration.
 * Overhaul of game state storage.
 * The above includes major contributions from Ron Koenderink.  Many
   thanks!

Changes to Empire 4.2.23 - Sun Oct 23 09:28:26 UTC 2005
 * Make version pretend option SHIPNAMES still exists, for the benefit
   of clients that still depend on it.
 * The change to conv in 4.2.22 could crash or compute incorrect
   maximum population.
 * Info updates missing in 4.2.22.
 * A few code cleanups.

Changes to Empire 4.2.22 - Tue Oct 11 20:23:51 UTC 2005
 * Log player login, logout and session kill.
 * Close loophole in assembly point rules that allowed players to find
   all unowned sectors.  The assembly point must now be owned by you
   or an ally, or you or an ally must have a ship there.
 * Don't let embarked land units fire flak.
 * Fix display of the last connection's host when the host name was
   not resolved.
 * Fix change command to accept full length representative (password),
   currently 19 characters.  It used to chop off after eight
   characters.
 * Non-recon missions no longer establish contact to owners of
   overflown sectors, because those missions do not identify the
   owner.  This matches info Hidden.
 * The following events now establish contact:
   - Catching a spy
   - Sighting a ship when toggle coastwatch is off
   - Spotting overflying planes
   - satellite spotting land units
   - lookout and llookout spotting ships, planes and land units
   - Any relations change
 * The country command's `temporary' state of disorder ended after
   ten years.
 * Telegram notifications could get lost in exotic circumstances,
   e.g. while a second client attempted to connect.  Can be abused for
   stealthy attacks.
 * Remove option SNEAK_ATTACK.
 * Fix lboard not to let you board dead land units.
 * Fix stack smash in bomb, drop, fly, paradrop, recon and sail.
   Remote hole!
 * bomb, drop, fly, paradrop, recon and sail now deal with EOF
   correctly.
 * Fix fly to let the player abort the command at the last prompt.
 * Client no longer reads execute scripts in binary mode under
   Windows.
 * New econfig key listen_address.
 * econfig key port can now be a service name.  Service empire no
   longer takes precedence over econfig.
 * Client falls back to compiled-in host only if environment doesn't
   supply one, not if it can't be resolved.  Same for port.
 * Oil derrick could extract slightly more oil than was in the ground.
 * test command checked start sector for space and some other things
   instead of end sector.
 * convert now silently limits conversions to avoid exceeding maximum
   population.
 * shoot no longer limits you to 999 victims.
 * 4.2.19 broke pin-bombing commodities on some platforms.
 * Don't block on output while update is pending.  This is required to
   ensure the update can abort commands.
 * Commands submitted while the update is waiting for commands to
   abort now fail.
 * The force command no longer waits for the specified time.  It
   starts a scheduling thread instead, just like shutdown.
 * Correct grammar and punctuation in output of version.
 * Option SHIPNAMES is no longer optional.
 * Fix output of qorder and sorder for ships with sail path.
 * Don't change capital to agribusiness on retake.  From Pat Loney.
 * bdes prompt for new designation was messed up for empty bmaps.
 * Client now supports pipes under Windows.
 * Care for subtle Windows socket incompatibilities.
 * Fix strength command not to lie about units reacting into
   mountains.
 * strength now yields the processor periodically, to keep the game
   responsive.
 * Schedule commands more fairly.  Previously, a sufficiently fast
   player could starve out the others.
 * launch assumed plane maximum mobility 127 for calculating when
   satellites will be ready to use.
 * Drop support for for DCE threads.
 * Drop support for pthread implementations lacking pthread_kill().
   This includes ancient versions of OS X.
 * Code cleanups.
 * Minor info file fixes.
 * The above includes major contributions from Ron Koenderink.  Many
   thanks!

Changes to Empire 4.2.21 - Sat Jul 16 17:51:01 UTC 2005
 * Don't let threads block on output to another player thread's
   socket.  Such blocking violates basic design assumptions and can
   cause all kinds of grief.  In particular, it causes player session
   hangs under Windows with 4.2.20.  Broken since the introduction of
   flash and asynchronous telegram notification many years ago.
 * Threads sleeping until a specified time could return early under
   Windows.  This could cause double-updates.
 * Fix fallout damage (was broken in 4.2.19).
 * Fix show sector s (was broken in 4.2.19).
 * Fix deliver not to deliver friendly civilians into occupied
   sectors.
 * Fix mil duplication in board (was broken in 4.2.14).
 * Fix stack smash in lrange, shoot and execute.  Remote holes, and
   the last one doesn't even require authentication.
 * Fix crash bug in emp_config parsing.
 * Fix buffer overruns in turn and shutdown.
 * Fix second argument of shutdown.
 * announce, pray, telegram and turn now abort on EOF.
 * Fix display of MOTD and game down message of maximum size.
 * Correctly support telnet line termination on input.  Previously,
   carriage returns could slip into ship names and such.
 * Fix flash not to lie about recipients that are just logging in.
 * Remove obscure login command list.
 * Convert client from obsolete termcap to terminfo, and clean up
   terminal handling.
 * New fairland option -h to print usage information.  Improved
   command line syntax diagnostics.  Exit unsuccessfully on unknown
   options.
 * fleet and army now copy retreat orders of the fleet's or army's
   first member with group retreat orders in the same sector.
   Previously, they used the retreat orders of the first fleet or army
   member, which is less than useful, and failed to take ownership
   into account, which is an abusable bug.
 * New xdump nation.
 * Fix xdump not to disclose other countries' losses.
 * Fix exit status of files program when it can't create files.
 * Support UTF-8 encoded Unicode in human-human communications.  This
   affects MOTD, game down message, telexes, announcements and flash
   messages.  See new doc/unicode for technical details.
 * New login command `options' for client/server option negotiation.
   See new doc/clients-howto for technical details.  The only option
   so far is utf-8.
 * emp_client -u now requests UTF-8.  This requires a terminal that
   understands UTF-8.
 * Fix news for land unit defensive support.
 * Properly mark sea mines hit by retreating ships.  Unmark mines
   cleared by bridges.
 * Fix diagnostics for unknown selector names in conditionals (was
   broken in 4.2.20).
 * Fix selector name clashes: rename ship selector mobquota to mquota,
   land selector for reaction range limit from rad to rmax.
 * Fix Windows services for relative file names on command line or in
   econfig (was broken in 4.2.20).
 * econfig keys ship_grow_scale, plane_grow_scale and land_grow_scale
   are now float.  This gives deities finer control over maximum
   efficiency gain.
 * Fix production command for sectors with 60% efficiency.
 * Improve syntax of read for deities.
 * Code cleanups.
 * Some info topic names differed only in case, which loses on
   case-insensitive file systems, and is a bad user interface even
   when it works.  Change those names.  Rename deity command hidden to
   peek because its info topic clashed with that of option HIDDEN.
 * Thanks to Doug Wescott sheep are finally covered properly in info.
 * Documentation fixes.
 * Much of the above was contributed by Ron Koenderink.  Many thanks!

Changes to Empire 4.2.20 - Tue Mar 22 21:07:18 UTC 2005
 * When units in different sectors marched, only units in the sector
   with the highest-numbered unit were interdicted.  A marching
   non-spy made all marching spies visible to interdiction regardless
   of location.
 * Fix crash when interdiction sinks second ship in a sector.  Broken
   in 4.0.10.
 * Fix an ancient bug in simulation of level production that clobbered
   stack and could lead to low predictions, typically zero, which
   screwed up budget.  The bug had no effect until 4.2.19.
 * When a sector revolts, and there wasn't enough space to liberate
   all uw, the number of remaining uw got the wrong sign.  Broken in
   4.2.14.
 * Log and abort when LWP stack check detects stack smash.  Server
   option -s no longer implies -p.
 * The native Windows build now supports -p and -s.
 * The native Windows build now properly deals with ^C when running in
   the foreground.  It no longer prompts for a quit command on the
   terminal.
 * The meaning of server option -D in presence of -e is unclear.
   Other programs only support -e.  Remove option -D.  Use -e
   DIR/econfig instead of -D DIR.
 * New server option -v shows version information.
 * Fix the server's exit status with -h.  Broken in 4.2.19.
 * The linux-pthreads build failed to shut down on signals.
 * Fix threading bugs in the native Windows build that made shutdown
   unsafe and screwed up update aborting commands.
 * New econfig key pre_update_hook to allow automatic, safe backup
   right before the update.  See scripts/backup for an example.
 * The server now prints log messages to stderr as well when running
   in the foreground.
 * Fix potential buffer overflows in logerror() and lwpStatus().
 * Server now requires POSIX signals.  It no longer catches SIGUSR1.
 * Remove support for ancient versions of HP-UX.
 * Fix seeding of PRNG broken in 4.2.19.
 * Don't reseed the PRNG in commands, it hurts randomness and could be
   abused by crafty players.
 * The server now makes the data directory its working directory.
   This also gets rid of a bug that changed the file name of the
   sector, power, nation and lostitems file unless econfig could not
   be read.
 * The server now writes a pid file.  Thanks to Daniel O'Connor.
 * More user friendly server startup: more errors are detected while
   the server still runs in the foreground, which makes it possible to
   complain to stderr and to exit unsuccessfully.
 * Early log messages went to the log file in the default data
   directory, even though econfig specifies another data directory.
 * Specifying an econfig file on the command line that can't be read
   is now fatal.
 * Errors in econfig are now fatal.
 * The server now refuses to start when it can't open data files.
 * News are now sorted and expire sanely.
 * Conditionals can now compare strings as well.
 * Corrupted down and motd files could cause buffer overflows.
 * Fix recon to let player abort at the flight path prompt.
 * power no longer rounds worldwide numbers for deities.
 * power command failed to recognize deities with non-zero country
   number.
 * Change output of production command so that columns are aligned
   even for large values.  Replace column wkfc by more useful column
   avail.
 * neweff and production miscalculated work when mil exceeded
   population limit.
 * neweff miscalculated work when the population limit exceeded 999.
 * Fix capping of avail when a big city is torn down.
 * Fix a bug in fire that allowed players to find all submarine uids.
 * Maximum sector population is no longer hardcoded, and now covered
   by xdump.  Option RES_POP now affects mountains and plains as
   well.  From Ray Hyatt.
 * Fix fina and news not to ignore errors in conditions.
 * The native Windows build now requires Windows Sockets 2.
 * The native Windows build now supports multiple instances of the
   service.  The ability to supply additional startup parameters to
   the service has been removed.
 * Implement fairland command line parsing under Windows.
 * Improved fairland and emp_server usage message.
 * Code cleanups.
 * Minor info file and documentation fixes.
 * Much of the above was contributed by Ron Koenderink.  Many thanks!

Changes to Empire 4.2.19 - Thu Dec 23 20:24:24 UTC 2004
 * Fix order not to unload into full sectors.
 * Fix scrap not to dump stuff into full sectors.  Excess stuff is now
   destroyed.
 * Fix distribute not to conjure up a civilian when importing
   civilians from a dist center that doesn't have any.
 * Fix flak to resupply no more shells than actually needed.
 * Fix rounding error in shoot that could result in more people shot
   than actually there.
 * Fix info and apro error handling.  In particular, do not leak
   potentially sensitive information on the server to players.
 * info no longer shows a random matching page when the topic argument
   is ambiguous.  Instead, it lists all matching topics.
 * Embarked land units and overflying planes no longer spot each
   other.
 * Fix show command to show only sectors that players can designate
   (was broken in 4.2.18).
 * Fix a rounding error in production command column `max'.
 * Fix production command for overpopulated mountains and plains.
 * Fix tradeship ally cut to match documentation.
 * Fix plague, which was was broken in 4.2.14: it got stuck in stage I.
 * Fix a bug in aerial sonar where ships could mask submarines with
   the same number modulo 256.
 * Don't allow bombing of subs that were not detected.
 * MOTD and the game down message are now entirely separate: use `turn
   motd' for the MOTD, and `turn on' and `turn off' for the game down
   message.  `turn on' no longer lets you edit the MOTD.
 * Remove option NUKEFAILDETONATE.
 * Option ORBIT is no longer optional.
 * New option GUINEA_PIGS to control experimental stuff not ready for
   prime time.  If your deity enables this in a serious game, run!
 * Many xdump fixes.  xdump is now enabled by option GUINEA_PIGS.
 * New ship and land selectors rflags, rpath.
 * New ship selectors for order: xstart. xend, ystart, yend,
   cargostart, cargend, amtstart, amtend
 * New ship selectors for sail: mobquota, path, follow.
 * New news selector uid.
 * Implement command line parsing under Windows where it was missing.
 * emp_server and and files print a usage message on command line
   syntax errors.
 * Fix how emp_server exits after being panicked by a signal.  It can
   now dump core when this happens.
 * Fix bug in client that could crash it when a line of input starts
   with '?'.
 * Client now gets user name from environment variable LOGNAME if set,
   else from system.
 * The native Windows build can now run as a service.
 * Redirecting client input now works under Windows.
 * Code cleanups.
 * Don't confuse work with loyalty in info Citizens.
 * Minor info file and manual page fixes.
 * Much of the above was contributed by Ron Koenderink and Marc
   Olzheim.  Many thanks!

Changes to Empire 4.2.18 - Tue Sep  7 14:08:59 UTC 2004
 * Fix info to accept abbreviated arguments under Windows.  From Ron
   Koenderink.
 * Buying planes or land units loaded on something didn't work when
   that something moved.
 * Fix a bug that could produce update cascades with update policy
   UDP_TIMES.
 * Fix delivery and distribution to grant packing bonus only to
   efficient sectors, just like move.  Previously, delivery ignored
   efficiency, and distribution behaved as if it were an efficient
   sector without special bonuses.
 * New sector selectors loyal, access; ship selectors radius, access,
   xbuilt, ybuilt, builder, name; plane selectors radius, access,
   theta; land unit selectors radius, react, nland, access; lost
   selector id.
 * Fix sector selectors che, che_target; plane selectors att, def;
   nuke selector types; treaty selector exp; news selector time;
   commodity selectors type, xbuy, ybuy.
 * Option PLANENAMES is no longer optional.
 * Ensure config parameter variables and their description in
   configkeys[] are consistent.  Inconsistencies there caused bugs in
   the past.  From Marc Olzheim.
 * Complain if econfig file can't be read.
 * Better messages for errors in econfig file.
 * Remove unused econfig keys hard_tech and last_demand_update.
 * New econfig key news_keep_days to configure news expiry.
 * New econfig key anno_keep_days to configure announcement expiry.
 * Fix announcement expiry.  It leaked file descriptors and memory,
   and could corrupt the anno file.  From Ron Koenderink.
 * New command xdump: experimental extended dump.  Disabled for now.
 * Bankers no longer round down debts, and they collect interest for
   the time debtors are idling at sub-prompts.
 * Loan interest calculation was broken at the due date and after a
   last payment made at the due date.  With luck, debtors could abuse
   this to repay loans cheap (they couldn't gain cash, though), sharks
   to purchase loans cheap, and creditors to collect excessively.
 * Fix major bug in transport that allowed two cooperating countries
   to duplicate items.
 * Don't report interdiction damage twice when transporting planes.
 * Fix message for attempting to transport a plane in a sector not
   owned by the player.
 * Fix confusing diagnostics when refusing to improve defense because
   option DEFENSE_INFRA is off.
 * Simplify confusing code in budget.
 * Fix spacing in output of budget and show.
 * Change one-way plane sorties to match ordinary sorties: offer
   carriers regardless of the sector they're in, require carriers to
   be efficient.
 * Allow `realm #'.
 * Don't print owner of incoming missile twice when intercepting it.
 * Simplify constituent storage in product characteristics.
 * Replace remaining `variables' leftovers; mainly in unit
   characteristics.
 * Remove leading spaces in deity unit dumps.
 * Replace inappropriate uses of compile time constant ETUS by 60.
   Deities don't change ETUS, they change etu_per_update by editing
   econfig.  This nonsense dates back at least to chainsaw 3.31.
 * Change ship production (fishing and drilling for oil) to match
   sector production.  Ship efficiency and tech are now relevant, and
   all people on board work.  From Ron Koenderink.
 * Code cleanups.
 * Minor info file fixes.

Changes to Empire 4.2.17 - Mon Aug 16 16:21:53 UTC 2004
 * Fix seeding of PRNG under Windows.  The bug made updates occur at
   a predictable time in the update window.  From Ron Koenderink.
 * Close major loophole in drop that allowed players to determine
   whether an arbitrary sector is sea, allied land, or other land.
 * fly could fly civilians into occupied sectors.  For consistency
   with other means to move around stuff, this is no longer possible.
 * Don't allow flying to a carrier that doesn't have space for the
   planes.  Previously, planes that did this were teleported home,
   which could be abused.
 * Close loophole in bomb that allowed players to find all
   sanctuaries.
 * Fix move and explore not to crash when moving civilians to a sector
   without civilians, and interdiction destroys them all.  Found and
   debugged by Jeff Cotter.
 * Fix printing of messages entered with turn command.  '%' characters
   could cause havoc, even crashes.
 * Use sector's actual maximum population to compute chance of plague
   outbreak.  Previously, code used 9999 for big cities and 999 for
   other sectors, and info Plague said 999.  This makes all crowded
   sectors equally vulnerable, even mountains, plains, and inefficient
   big cities.
 * Oil derricks no longer drill and deplete more oil than they can
   hold.  From Ron Koenderink.
 * Version 4.2.15's coordinate and list parsing fixes reject trailing
   junk.  That's too strict.  Silently ignore trailing junk as long as
   it starts with whitespace.
 * Version 4.2.15's selector rewrite broke some type literals,
   e.g. `?des=n' was interpreted as `?des=newdes'.  Change to prefer
   type literals to selectors.
 * Nightly build patches game to get repeatable PRNG results.  From
   Marc Olzheim.

Changes to Empire 4.2.16 - Wed Jun 16 18:56:16 UTC 2004
 * Previous version broke sector production when part of the work is
   used for sector construction.  Fix courtesy Jeff Cotter.
 * Add rudimentary tests to nightly build.  From Marc Olzheim.

Changes to Empire 4.2.15 - Wed May 26 17:55:58 UTC 2004
 * test command no longer asks whether to abandon the sector.
 * explore command could generate a bogus `lost' record when it
   regains an abandoned start sector.
 * edit command now properly updates stats when editing tech level of
   ships, planes or land units.  A few of these stats can be edited
   separately, which doesn't make much sense, and is now deprecated.
 * edit command no longer accepts efficiency values that would destroy
   the edited unit.  Deities can still delete units by setting the
   owner to zero.
 * upgrade command used to charge an amount of avail that didn't match
   info upgrade.  Neither the implemented nor the documented amount
   made much sense.  Change it to 15% of the full build cost.  Rewrite
   info upgrade.
 * Commands upgrade and build could be off by one when reporting
   required avail.
 * upgrade command reported rounded cost but charged unrounded
   cost.  Round cost of upgrade down to match behavior of build.
 * Upgrading planes now preserves range when it is less than the
   maximum range.  It used to set it to the new maximum range.
 * show bridge and show tower no longer claim bridge building requires
   `workers' (whatever that is), since it doesn't.
 * Replace option ROLLOVER_AVAIL by econfig parameter
   rollover_avail_max, which is the maximum amount of avail that rolls
   over.  Previously, avail was limited after rollover, and even when
   ROLLOVER_AVAIL was off.  Fix that.
 * Ships weren't always charged mobility for firing with option
   NOMOBCOST off.
 * Fix shell use of return torpedoes.
 * designate no longer complains twice about deity only designations.
 * Ensure designate zaps efficiency only when sector type really
   changes.
 * Fix strength to always report mines to deities.
 * Remove option SHIP_DECAY.
 * Fix bug in sonar that could crash or yield unpredictable results
   near the true origin.
 * Fix buffer overflow in flash and wall.
 * Fix wall not to strip out first word of message.
 * Change market and order to use item types instead of mnemo
   characters internally.
 * Market now reports sales with full item names instead of single
   letter codes.
 * buy now requires first argument to be an item name, as documented.
 * production command handled production backlog incorrectly, failed
   to limit production for production efficiency greater than one,
   e.g. agribusiness, and incorrectly limited raw material
   consumption.  Also fix a rounding error.  With help from Ron
   Koenderink.
 * Sector work was accidentally truncated to even.
 * Fix coordinate parsing for large numbers when WORLD_X or WORLD_Y
   don't divide SHRT_MAX+1.
 * Properly diagnose over-long unit lists.
 * Rewrite selector code.  Old code let players smash the stack by
   supplying too many conditions.  New code properly rejects ambiguous
   abbreviations and prefers exact matches.  Selectors with names that
   collide with types, like land units' rad and spy, now work.
   Selectors with non-integral values, like land units' att, now work.
 * survey used to display hundreds for everything but variables.  Now
   it displays hundreds only for values that can be large.
 * Rewrite info survey.  Document ability to survey properties other
   than items and resources.
 * Rewrite info build, since it was inaccurate and poorly structured.
 * Fix info fire on required military.  From Marc Olzheim.
 * New fairland argument -R to set the PRNG seed.  Print the seed.
   This allows you to recreate the same world again.
 * New facilities to deal with internal errors.  These crash when the
   server is started with -d, which is appropriate for debugging, and
   potentially disastrous for running a real game.
 * Automated nightly builds.
 * Code cleanups.

Changes to Empire 4.2.14 - Mon Mar 22 09:04:12 UTC 2004
 * Options NEWPOWER, NEW_STARVE and NEW_WORK are no longer optional.
 * Gripe about unknown options in econfig.
 * Remove option GRAB_THINGS.
 * Utility program files takes new option -f.
 * Remove utility programs land, ore and perfect, which don't compile
   since 4.2.0 (Oct '98).
 * fairland no longer warns when it added resources, but when it
   didn't.
 * Fallout code could claim destruction of more items than actually
   existed.
 * Fix recursive resupply (resupply from supply land unit triggering a
   resupply of the land unit) when just testing for how much can be
   resupplied.  The bug could have led to insufficient resupply.
 * Fix recursive resupply not to consume all fuel in supply units.  No
   supply units consuming fuel exist in the stock game.
 * Limit delivery and distribution thresholds to ITEM_MAX (9999).
   Distribution threshold were previously limited to 10000, and
   delivery thresholds to 65528.
 * Limit items in sectors to ITEM_MAX (9999).  Commands give and buy
   used to limit to 9990.  Market transactions and commands explore,
   move, drop and fly to 32767.  Limiting in autonav code (order
   command) didn't work.  Item delivery used to stop at 9990,
   distribution at 9999.  Food growing and sector production used to
   stop at 9999.  Grind, assault lunchboxes, demobilization, mine
   sweeping and che liberating uw could theoretically attempt to
   increase items beyond 65535, which would have been ignored
   (destroying the increase).
 * Properly saturate fallout at FALLOUT_MAX (9999).  Previously,
   fallout increases behaved inconsistently.  Increases beyond 65535
   could get ignored, or fallout could saturate at 9999, or it could
   overflow at 65536 (that would take quite some nuking, though).
 * Properly saturate mines at MINES_MAX (65535).  Previously, a mining
   operation that would have gone beyond 65535 was ignored.
 * Fix `are we loading or unloading' tests for load, unload, lload and
   lunload.
 * Fix editing of land unit attack and defense values.  Implement
   editing of ship defense values.  Contributed by Ron Koenderink.
 * edit now edits che number and target separately.
 * Fix edit to properly extend unit files.  Contributed by Ron
   Koenderink.
 * Major internal reorganisation: Sectors need space for items,
   deliveries and distribution thresholds.  To save space, the
   ancients invented `variables': a collection of key-value pairs,
   missing means zero value, space for `enough' keys.  This
   complicates the code, as assigning to a `variable' can fail for
   lack of space.  Over time, `enough' increased, and for quite some
   time now `variables' have been *wasting* space.  Replace them,
   except in unit characteristics, where they are read-only, and will
   be replaced later.  This also removes misfeatures like plague
   outbreaks silently deleting deliveries.
 * Remove disabled commands dissolve and mult.  Remove configuration
   parameters minmult and maxmult.
 * trade command indexed an array out of bounds when attempting to
   display the plague as commodity.  Fix.
 * New make goal interix.  Contributed by Ron Koenderink.
 * The type selector now prefers an exact match to a partial match.
   ?type=sb now selects sb, not sbc, even when sbc happens to be found
   first.
 * Value of selector sell was always zero, remove it.
 * Clean up selector code.
 * satellite now displays all sectors owned by other players, and none
   else.  It used to display all but sea, mountains, sanctuaries,
   wasteland and wilderness.
 * map commands now display wilderness and plains owned by other
   players as '?'.  Radar commands now display all wilderness and
   plains as '?'.
 * Fix power timestamp for Windows.  Contributed by Ron Koenderink.
 * Make client abort the current command on ^C under Windows, as
   everywhere else.  Contributed by Ron Koenderink.
 * Command line parser interpreted trailing whitespace as an another
   (empty) argument.  Ignore it instead.
 * Properly declare stuff in headers, include proper system headers.
   Remove all nested external declarations.  Source code is now fully
   prototyped.  Enable appropriate gcc warnings.
 * Fix several type errors.  Some may have been show-stoppers on big
   endian machines where sizeof(long) != sizeof(int).
 * Remove pre-ISO C compatibility cruft (hey, it's been only fifteen
   years).
 * Various portability fixes.  Some bugs may have been show-stoppers
   when sizeof(long) != sizeof(int).  With help from Marc Olzheim and
   Ron Koenderink.
 * Move some code to more logical places.  Remove some unused code,
   some of which was hard to port.
 * The files program could print error messages to a log file in some
   circumstances.  Make it print to stderr.
 * deliver can now change direction without changing the threshold.
 * deliver now provides appropriate context when prompting for
   thresholds.

 * Accuracy calculation in land unit support was backwards.
 * Corrected formula for likelihood of plague in info Plague.
 * Fixed files to correctly size map and bmap files from econfig file.

Changes to Empire 4.2.8 - Mon Oct  9 17:35:35 MDT 2000
 * Fixed range in radar.t and Sector-types.t.  Maximum range at infinite
   tech is 16.

Changes to Empire 4.2.7 - Fri Mar 10 18:41:04 PST 2000
 * Added new NF_SACKED flag to indicate when a country has had it's
   capital sacked.  This flag is only cleared when the country actively
   redesignates it's capital using the "capital" command, and changed
   capital.t to reflect this (no more re-sacking after an update if the
   country doesn't reset and repeating until they are out of cash.)
 * Added land unit to edit command for planes.
 * Added nuketype to edit command for planes.
 * Changed so that if the leader of a group of units is a train, the
   railways are used for bestpath instead of roadways.
 * Changed mission command to also print reaction radius of reserve
   missions when set for land units.
 * Changed Flak.t to reflect guns having to be loaded onto a land unit
   for flak to fire.
 * Changed so that visitor countries cannot change their name or password.
 * Changed so that you cannot upgrade deity planes, ships or units.
 * Changed so that you know where missions are flown from.
 * Changed so that the airport owner you fly a mission from is informed.
 * Changed so that preperations for takeoff are reported to the owner of
   the sector, ship or unit a plane is taking off from if it is not owned
   by the owner of the plane.
 * Changed so that when a sector reverts during a guerrilla revolt, the
   mobility is not reset.  When MOB_ACCESS is not enabled, this used to mean
   you would always get at least an updates worth of mobility.  With
   MOB_ACCESS, sectors that reverted during the update were useless, since you
   got no mobility for a long time.  This fixes that problem, and makes che
   more useful as well.
 * Changed so that air defense missions don't always send up every plane in the
   area, but instead always send up at most two times the number of incoming
   planes (for each interdicting country.) This helps to stop 1 plane from
   stripping the mobility from 25 air defense planes all at once, but doesn't
   limit it to n+1 as there is for regular interception.
 * Clarified deity reversion of sectors in Sector-ownership.t
 * Clarified production efficiency and added pointer to "show sector cap"
   in Product.t
 * Clarified nuketype selector for planes in Selector.t
 * Clarified that fortifying units does not affect mission status in info
   pages for mission and fortify.
 * Clarified fuel syntax upon error in fuel command in empmod.c.
 * Cleaned up comments causing minor complaints in some builds.
 * Fixed bug in loans where you could collect on proposed loans.
 * Fixed production command to be more accurate (though it *still* has some
   rounding errors, it's better.)
 * Fixed potential memory leak in air defense missions.
 * Fixed bug where you couldn't pinbomb some commodities if other commodities
   didn't already exist in the sector.
 * Fixed bug where you couldn't build 0 crew planes without military in the
   sector.  (This is different from needing at least 1 military to build all
   planes that need a crew which introduced another related bug earlier.)
 * Fixed bug where scrapping land unit 0 could cause erroneous transfer
   messages to be displayed for deity owned planes.
 * Fixed bug where land units on ships in a sector taken over were blown
   up or captured.
 * Fixed bug where planes on ships in a sector taken over were blown up
   or captured.
 * Fixed bug in sdump printing origx and origy in deity coordinates.
 * Fixed bug in satellites showing wrong sectors (sometimes) when using the
   optional arguments.
 * Fixed bug in launch showing wrong satellite target (showed asat instead
   of the target satellite.)
 * Fixed bug where you could gain information not normally available using
   the "fire" command to determine sector type information.
 * Fixed bug in market/trade creating extra money when loans are taken out.
 * Fixed problem with land units not being reported sunk after being sunk
   on a ship that was nuked or wastelanded in a sector.
 * Fixed problem with Spies.t using "llook" instead of "llookout".
 * Fixed problem in lwp/arch.c including jmp_buf.h instead of setjmp.h
   on some Linux boxes.
 * Fixed problem with plague infection being way too high in cities when
   the BIG_CITY option is enabled.
 * Fixed bug in edit command getting confused with arguments.
 * Fixed bug in ask_move_in_off asking you to move in a negative number of
   troops (hey, it could happen. :) )
 * Fixed bug in add command not keeping flags or relations initially correct.
 * Fixed bug in torpedo command sometimes telling victim about torpedo
   sightings even when way out of range.
 * Fixed bug in spy command not reporting planes in adjacent sectors, as well
   as not formatting them properly when reporting them.
 * Fixed bug in satellite with noisy transmission causing a potential
   crash of the server with non-100% efficient satellites.
 * Fixed potential crashing of the server during satellite display when not
   calculating distances to ships and units correctly.
 * Fixed bug where planes in non-allied sectors, ships and units could be
   used on missions.
 * Fixed bug where planes on the trading block could be used on missions.
 * Fixed bug where planes and units that get traded don't have mobility set
   correctly when using MOB_ACCESS option.
 * Fixed bug which made security units virtually useless.
 * Fixed access times and mobility not being set right when building planes,
   ships, units, bridges and bridge towers when MOB_ACCESS is enabled.
 * Fixed minor formatting problem with launch of satellites.
 * Fixed minor formatting problem with planes with greater than 999 tech.
 * Fixed minor formatting problem with ships with greater than 999 tech.
 * Fixed problem with "llook" showing up in TOP info file.
 * Fixed problem with lwp Makefile choking on NT builds with clean target.
 * General cleanup of potentially ambiguous statements.

Changes to Empire 4.2.6 - Fri Jun  4 05:55:20 PDT 1999
 * Added "TECH_POP" as an option where technology costs more to make
   as your population grows past 50K civilians.  It is disabled by
   default.
 * Changed "produce" command to accurately print what the true p.e. is.
 * Changed "update" command to display if mobility updating is enabled for
   MOB_ACCESS option.
 * Fixed bug where toggling off the coastwatch flag also turned off
   forts firing on hostile ships coming into range.
 * Fixed bug where assaulting your own land would violate any treaties
   you have where assaults are a violation.
 * Fixed bug where all planes (even those without need for a crew, such
   as missiles) needed at least 1 military to build.
 * Fixed bug where when a ship sinks during the update due to lack of maint,
   land units and planes on it were left stranded.
 * Fixed bug where when a land unit dies during the update due to lack of
   maint, land units and planes on it were left stranded on it.
 * Fixed bug where nukes could be lost due to MOB_ACCESS updating mobility
   while arming.
 * Fixed bug in "show sector capabilities" not showing products correctly.
 * Fixed bug in "show tower build" printing "bridges" instead of "bridge
   towers".
 * Fixed bug in sectors that don't revolt not showing up as lost items.
 * Fixed bug where maps with an X of exactly 200 is not drawing third line.
 * Fixed bug where MOB_ACCESS was not updating the mobility just before
   the update.
 * Fixed bug in the way treaties are examined and sometimes produce
   wrong results.
 * Fixed edit to allow creating negative mobility for sectors.
 * Fixed setsector to allow creating negative mobility for sectors.
 * Fixed bug where when writing out the value of a sector that had
   negative mobility and was damaged in combat, mobility was being
   set back to 0.
 * Fixed Taxes.t info page to reflect that captured civvies only pay
   1/4 taxes.
 * Fixed Technology.t info page to reflect TECH_POP option.
 * Fixed navigate.t info page to reflect that only ships in the fleet
   in the same sector that are fired upon have damage divided up.
 * Made techlists toggle on by default (so things are shown in order of
   technological advances.)

Changes to Empire 4.2.5 - Mon Mar  1 06:42:24 PST 1999
 * Added optimization to increasing mobility to check if an object is
   already at max mob, just return since it can't be increased.
 * Added "-ltermcap" for client libs for hp build (it was already in
   hpux build.)
 * Added clearing of telegram flags after the update so that the next
   telegram is flagged as new and not part of the update.
 * Fixed Update-sequence.t to reflect MOB_ACCESS.
 * Fixed bug where fortification amount was not being limited to
   maximum mobility for land units (land_mob_max).
 * Fixed bug where land unit fortification strength was being calculated
   by using 127 instead of land_mob_max.
 * Fixed bug where scrapping land units was creating military.
 * Fixed description of sect_mob_neg_factor in econfig file.
 * Increased speed of PT boats.

Changes to Empire 4.2.4 - Tue Feb  2 05:47:44 PST 1999
 * Added check to make military values match up correctly for land
   units.
 * Fixed bug in doconfig not putting ipglob.c in the right place.
 * Fixed bug where attacking deity sectors will violate a treaty.
 * Fixed newspaper.t information file.
 * Fixed potential bug in fixing up timestamp information when restarting a
   game with MOB_ACCESS turned on.
 * Fixed bug in explore command not setting mobility to correct
   value when MOB_ACCESS was enabled.
 * Fixed bug in enlist setting mobility incorrectly sometimes.
 * Added doc/backup file for deities which recommends how backups and
   restores of the data directory should be done.

Changes to Empire 4.2.3 - Wed Jan 13 06:02:35 PST 1999
 * Added linux-pthreads target and build for using pthreads under Linux.
 * Added NO_FORT_FIRE option which disables the ability of forts to
   fire when enabled.
 * Added more error checking and recovery for corrupt data files.
 * Changed alphapos target to alpha-pthreads for better clarity.
 * Changed fairland to allow 0 sector distance to other islands and
   continents (James Risner)
 * Changed "frg" and "dam" land unit stats to "rng" and "fir" so they
   match the way ships are described (since this is how they really work.)
 * Changed Unit-types.t to now describe "rng" as firing range of a unit,
   and "fir" as the number of guns that a land unit fires.
 * Cleaned up misc. build warnings.
 * Changed artillery damage to be 5 + d6 per gun firing from just d6
   per gun firing and updated Damage.t to reflect this change.
 * Changed artillery firing ranges to be like ships ranges - divided
   by two, and modified them to make more sense.
 * Changed artillery units to be "slightly" :) more powerful.
 * Changed "cavalry" unit to tech 30 and lowered mil content to 20.
 * Changed "artillery" unit to tech 35.
 * Changed so that guns are no longer required to build units, and
   that guns must be loaded onto artillery units for them to fire.
   Client developers note: the show command has not changed yet to
   remove the 'guns' column (since guns are no longer required) but
   will in a future revision (possibly 4.2.4) so "be prepared" for
   "show land build" to change. :)
 * Fixed landunitgun to handle all the damage calculations like it should.
 * Fixed bug sinking planes when the ship they are on sinks.
 * Fixed bug destroying planes when the land unit they are on is destroyed.
 * Fixed bug where land units could fire support without enough military.
 * Fixed bug in abandoning sectors by marching out a land unit where it
   would not let you sometimes (uninitialized variable problem.)
 * Fixed gets problem in files.c (James Risner)
 * Fixed bug in determinig operations range of a ship.
 * Fixed bug in building planes where you could manufacture military.
 * Fixed warnings in threading package(s).
 * Fixed fire.t to reflect new firing changes.
 * Fixed lstat.t to reflect new firing changes.
 * Fixed sstat.t to reflect the way things really work.
 * Fixed Ship-types.t to reflect the way things really work.
 * Fixed the way shutdowns work to hopefully better protect data files.
 * Fixed bug in attacking when sector mobility is less than 0 and it would
   prompt for attacking with a negative amount of military.
 * Fixed typo in fire.t stating wrong parameters for firing from a sector.
 * Fixed bug in client when it prompts for country name it was putting
   an extraneous end of line on the end that needed to be stripped off.
 * Fixed problems running on Linux running on an Alpha machine.  Thanks
   to Rocky Mountain Internet and Jeremy A. Cunningham for giving us time
   on a machine to work out the bugs.  (Note that the only build that
   works on Linux/Alpha is the linux-pthreads)

Changes to Empire 4.2.2 - Sun Dec 27 12:46:34 PST 1998
 * Added some code optimizations into the update code when building paths.
 * Added some new cacheing for building paths to help speed up updates.
 * Added so that you can use "name" and "password" with the change command
   as well as "country" and "representative".
 * Added flag to power command so that if you are a deity and enter
   a negative number of countries you want to see, you see the power chart
   for that many countries without power numbers on the next line.  Only
   useful for deities that want to see the chart un-broken up by that line.
 * Added new functionality to fortify command.  You can now use a negative
   fortification value to cause the unit to be fortified and leave at
   least that much mobility on the unit. I.E. "fort * -67" will fortify
   all units and make sure the mobility of each unit doesn't go below
   67.  If the mobility is already below that level (or equal) the unit
   is left unchanged.
 * Added that the realm command prints "Realm #n is x:x,y:y" after
   you set a new realm.
 * Added TREATIES option and enabled it by default.
 * Added "no depth-charging subs" and "no new land units" treaty
   clauses.
 * Added Trannie Carter's basic client fix to use fgets instead of gets.
 * Changed market and command to only print the lowest priced lot of
    each given commodity by default.  If you specify "all" it shows
    all lots on the market, and if you specify a specific item, it shows
    all lots of that item type.
 * Changed start command to only write out sector if it changed.
 * Changed stop command to only write out sector if it changed.
 * Changed how plane names were changed on server startup if the
   PLANENAMES option was enabled.
 * Changed move command to use standard askyn function for abandoning
   sector prompt.
 * Changed plane overlight sightings to take stealth into account,
   and if the planes managed to evade all flak and interceptors, they
   are not marked as "spotted" over enemy sectors.
 * Changed all units with the supply flag to have their marching speeds
   based on efficiency since that is their purpose.  What this means is
   that supply units and trains are more effective at 100% than at 10%
   (just as fighting units are more effective at 100% than at 10%, but
    their effectiveness is determined by how well they fight, not how well
    they "run away, run away!" :) )
 * Changed so that flash toggle is on by default for POGO at setup
   time.
 * Changed so that when a sector is taken, all land units owned by the
   current owner are treated as planes are during takeovers (i.e. there
   is a pretty good chance they are blown up, and if not, they change owner
   to the attacker and are beat up pretty good.)
 * Fixed treaties to work again.
 * Fixed bug in taking over land units not using correct pointer (can
   cause a crash or data corruption.)
 * Fixed collect command to wipe deliver and distribution information
   correctly.
 * Fixed potential bug in bmap not working when destination bmap has
   blank spaces in it.
 * Fixed bug in shark command not getting right nation structure.
 * Fixed bug in server where empty commands (for example, all spaces
   or tabs) were being reported as bogus commands.  They are now just
   ignored.
 * Fixed bug in scrap not dropping land units off of scrapped units carrying
   them.
 * Fixed bug in news where boarding of land units was reported backwards.
 * Fixed bug in calculating new people when growing them during an update.
 * Fixed missing -ltermcap in HP/UX build.
 * Fixed setsector to limit mobility to 127 not 255 (255 was being caught
   later and being reset to 0 anyway)
 * Fixed Sector-types.t to show a '\e' instead of a '/' for wasteland,
   since that is what it really is.
 * Fixed retreat.t documentation to reflect the "retreat upon failed
   boarding" flag.
 * Fixed bug where satellites were not orbiting the world during the
   update.
 * Fixed bug in torpedos being too smart.  They knew how to jump over
   land! :)  Now the "line_of_sight" routine is used to determine if a
   torpedo has a straight path to the destination.  If it doesn't, the
   torpedo no longer jumps over land, but instead slams into it.  This was
   an interesting bug because you could torp ships on the other side of
   a very skinny island as long as they were in range, even if there was
   no sea route possible.
 * Fixed bug when pinbombing and you run out of an object to pinbomb (land
   units for example) but you still have to pick something to bomb.  For
   ships it worked ok (just aborted that it couldn't find any more ships)
   and this was fixed for land units and planes.
 * Fixed server crashing bug when flying a plane and not carrying
   any cargo.
 * Fixed bug in move losing commodities when it runs out of room in the
   destination sector.  Goods are now attempted to be returned to the
   start sector, and apporpriate steps taken if the start sector is no
   longer available.
 * Fixed march to prompt you before you abandon a sector you own by
   marching out the last land unit.
 * Fixed check functions to only check the relevant portions of the structure
   and not the timestamp info that doesn't affect how the object functions.
 * Fixed bug in spy command that always told you if a spy unit was in a
   non-owned sector.
 * Fixed bug in displaying of land unit missions not showing correct land
   unit range.
 * Fixed bug in wire command where new announcements that you read at
   the last second don't get wiped out properly.
 * Fixed bug where announcement file could be corrupted by very long lines.
 * Fixed bug where bmap was not set when player was told what kind of
   sector they were attacking (this was an old abusable bug that was
   removed long ago to fix the abuse, and it's been fixed in a non-abusable
   way finally.)
 * Fixed bug where change command would warn you about monetary and
   BTU costs, but not prompt you to break out if you didn't want to really
   change your country name.
 * Fixed bug in sub-launched nukes that are intercepted being reported in
   the news incorrectly.
 * Fixed bug in load where you could abandon a sector and not know it by
   loading your last civilians or military onto a ship.
 * Fixed potential memory leak in autonav code.
 * Fixed potential bug where you could possibly determine if a sector is
   owned or not using one way plane missions.
 * Fixed Damage.t info page to properly show damages for planes and
   land unit shelling.
 * Fixed deliver.t to include syntax for command.
 * Fixed country.t to include syntax for command.
 * Fixed bug where ships on orders were not adding radar information to
   the bmap during an update.
 * Fixed bug where ships on sail were not adding radar information to
   the bmap during an update.
 * Fixed bestownedpath code to use the bmap properly.  Note this is a very
   important bug fix.  When navigating a ship, players are no longer given
   free information that they would not normally know.  For example, if you
   try sailing your ship off into uncharted areas of your bmap, the bestpath
   code will only use as much information as you have on-hand (i.e. your
   bmap) to plan out your path for you.  If you have no information on an
   area, it just keeps forging on, until bumping into something.  Of course,
   after the initial exploration through an area, the bmap will be set and
   used for all future sailings through that area.  Harbors and bridges
   are still checked for construction worthiness if you know where they
   are (i.e. they are on your bmap.) (Overall, what happened before
   was that the bestpath code would route your ship around islands that
   you didn't even know were there, and you could use various commands
   to see how that ship was going to sail during the update and thus you
   gained information that you wouldn't normally know.)
 * Merged bestpath and bestownedpath and wrote new wrappers, "BestShipPath"
   and "BestAirPath" to use it properly.  It is also good to note that
   bestownedpath is used to determine paths for ships and for planes,
   and that best_path (which uses the A* algorithm) is used for all land
   based paths, and that the two are never interchanged.
 * Removed "jet recon" plane (it slipped in during the PLANENAMES conversion,
   and RECON was never used before.)
 * Removed extraneous "resnoise" and "resbenefit" functions and combined
   the two for setresource and setsector commands.

Changes to Empire 4.2.1 - Tue Nov  3 12:56:20 PST 1998
 * Fixed problem with global/plane.c not defining last structure element
   properly, and thus causing crashes when accessing certain plane
   routines.  This happened during the move to make the PLANENAMES option
   run-time configurable.

Changes to Empire 4.2.0 - Thu Oct 29 06:27:15 PST 1998
 * Bumped rev to 4.2.0 since this is a major release (the server is now
   run-time configurable for just about everything and is released under
   the GNU GPL.)
 * Put in official licensing information.
 * Re-arranged and commented the econfig (Empire Configuration) file.  The
   auto-generated "data/econfig" file is now pumped out chock full of
   comments (which may or may not be useful.)  Since the server is
   pretty much fully run-time configurable (MAXNOC is not, but it gets
   a default of 99 anyway) deities will probably be spending more time
   in the config file.
 * Added server support for building under NT, including mods from
   Doug Hay and Steve McClure to get the server building and running
   under NT. (This was built using MSVC++ 5.0 on NT 4.0 and command
   line "nmake nt")
 * Added Doug Hay's ntthread.c implementation for NT threading.
 * Added max pop column to "show sector stats" output.
 * Added lboard command for boarding land units from sectors.  Only raw
   mil can board land units, and only mil and land units aboard the unit
   being boarded fight back.
 * Added GODNEWS option.  When enabled, the deity giving people stuff
   is shown in the news.
 * Added bridge tower sector ('@')
 * Added BRIDGETOWERS option.  When enabled you can build bridge towers
   from a bridge span.  You can then build bridge spans from the tower.
   If the tower is destroyed ( <20% eff) bridges connected fall unless
   supported on the other side.  You can only build bridge towers in open
   water not adjacent to land and other towers.  Expensive.
 * Added plains sector ('~') - Max pop is 1/40th regular sectors, and
   it is deity creatable only (can't redesignate unless you wasteland it
   with a nuke :) )
 * Changed "info all" to no longer use printdir, instead it just uses the "all"
   info page which contains this information.
 * Changed so you can now load up to 2 spy units onto non-land unit carrying
   submarines if the LANDSPIES option is enabled.  Useful for sneaking up
   to shore and spying on your neighbors.
 * Changed so spies unloaded from ships are not given as gifts, they are just
   unloaded quietly.
 * Changed build command to handle building towers ("build t")
 * Changed show command to show tower stats ("show t b")
 * Changed reject so you can now reject things from any country except
   deity countries (this now includes sanctuary countries and visitor
   countries you don't want to deal with)
 * Changed ndump to dump nuclear stockpile ID as well.
 * Changed flash so that if someone allied to you is either not logged on or
   not accepting flashes, you are notified.  This is info you could gain
   otherwise since you can see other countries that are allied to you via
   players.
 * Fixed bug in news command when HIDDEN mods are enabled.
 * Fixed distribute command to only write out to the database if we
   actually changed the sector (i.e. if we really moved the dist
   center, we write.  Otherwise, it makes no point.)
 * Fixed threshold command to only write out to the database if
   we actually changed the sector (i.e. if we really changed the
   threshold, we write.  Otherwise, it makes no point.)
 * Fixed - population growth and truncation in "Update-sequence.t" info
   file is now clearer
 * Fixed the way fortify takes mobility away from a land unit if
   engineers are present.
 * Fixed bug in buying commodities at the last minute not resetting the
   time correctly in all situations.
 * Fixed bug in building nukes where it would always ask if you tried
   building more than one at a time.
 * Fixed bug where if you put (either by building or by transporting)
   more than 127 of one type of nuke in a sector, they all got lost. A
   negative wrapover sort of thing.
 * Fixed ndump to print # of stockpiles dumped.
 * Fixed ndump.t to reflect changes
 * Fixed bug in build command that didn't account for EOL characters.
 * Fixed bug where you could use planes to drop conquered populace
 * Fixed bug in distribute command in how it checked for current distribution
   sector.
 * Fixed pr_flash and pr_inform to no longer send messages if the player
   is still in the process of logging in (i.e. not in the PLAYING state)
 * Fixed report command output for deities.
 * Fixed bug in nuclear damage either taking out submarines when it
   shouldn't, or not taking them out when it should.
 * Fixed bug in loading units that are carrying units onto other units
   (note that it doesn't happen since only HEAVY units can carry other
   units and that check works, but that might change some day, and we
   don't want units carrying units to be carried by other units, etc. :) )
 * Fixed info pages to reflect new sector types.
 * Fixed info pages to reflect new spy unit capabilities.
 * Fixed show commands to only show trade ships if the TRADESHIPS option
   is enabled.
 * Fixed build command to only allow building of trade ships if the
   TRADESHIPS options is enabled.
 * Fixed up some definitions located in many places used for checking
   sectors for navigation rights.
 * Fixed power.t to correctly describe NEW_POWER formula.
 * Made HIDDEN option run time configurable.
 * Made LOSE_CONTACT option run time configurable.
 * Made ORBIT option run time configurable.
 * Made SAIL option run time configurable.
 * Made MOB_ACCESS option run time configurable.
 * Made FALLOUT option run time configurable.
 * Made SLOW_WAR option run time configurable.
 * Made SNEAK_ATTACK option run time configurable.
 * Made WORLD_X and WORLD_Y run time configurable.
 * Made MARKET option run time configurable.
 * Made LOANS option run time configurable.
 * Made BIG_CITY option run time configurable.
 * Made TRADESHIPS option run time configurable.
 * Made SHIPNAMES option run time configurable.
 * Made DEMANDUPDATE option run time configurable.
 * Made UPDATESCHED option run time configurable.
 * Made LANDSPIES option run time configurable.
 * Made NONUKES option run time configurable.
 * Made PLANENAMES option run time configurable.
 * Removed SMALL_SERVER stuff (unused baggage)
 * Removed trading post sector ('v')

Changes to Empire 4.0.18 - Thu Sep 24 06:54:27 PDT 1998
 * Fixed bug in aircombat where planes in flight could intercept air
   defense planes and take no damage (i.e. they got to fight twice,
   once for free.)
 * Fixed bug in freeing memory after performing missions that could crash
   the server (it mainly happened after an interdiction mission using
   planes and escorts, where some escorts came from airports that didn't have
   bombers going up.  Freeing the leftover escorts was crashing the server.)
 * Fixed bug where you could load non-existant units if you were allied
   with country #0.

   the server.
 * Fixed bug that after you read telegrams new telegrams may not send
   an inform message (the old telegram flags were not cleared.)
 * Fixed bug where fort support distance calculations are calculated
   twice instead of just once.  This bug caused a lower percentage
   of support fire than designed.
 * Fixed bomb.t to reflect land unit changes.
 * Put in some integrity checking for planes returing from bombing runs.
 * Added ability to edit land unit that a land unit is loaded on in
   edit command.

   existed in at least 3 places, and was different in all of them.)
 * Subs returning fire are no longer reported in the news.
 * Visitor countries can now use the 'motd' command.
 * When trying to use a visitor country, if it is in use, you are not told
   by whom, just that it is in use.

   military personnel on board to see anything.
 * Fixed "llookout.t" to reflect change for military requirement.
 * Updated Plague.t

   which determines mineral (iron) content of a sector.)
 * No longer able to pin bomb land units on a ship.
 * Land units are required to have at least one military loaded to perform
   a mission.
 * Firing land units are required to have at least on military loaded to
   be able to fire (or return fire.)

 * Fixed bug in count_planes always writing out ships unnecessarily.
 * Fixed bug in lnd_count_units always writing out land units unnecessarily.
 * Fixed bug in count_units always writing out ships unnecessarily.
 * Fixed bug in llook that reported units on ships.

 * Fixed bug in planes getting extended range when on missions and the
   op center is not where the plane is located.

   countries to create infinite numbers of any commodity and/or cash
   at any time (race conditions in the server): build, board, deliver,

   some reason, this was causing a problem on one of the Linux builds (??).
 * Added "show sector capabilities" functionality (this didn't exist
   before.)
 * Fixed bug in neweff not reporting stopped sectors.  It now (correctly)
   reports them as not changing eff.

Changes to Empire 4.0.15 - Wed May 20 12:35:53 EDT 1998
 * Fixed the spelling of Markus' name in CHANGES4.0 files.

   mil on units and ships)
 * Fixed bug in printing of "No ship(s)" twice in cargo command when no
   ships were selected.

   on production.
 * Fixed bug in produce command reporting incorrect costs (sometimes).
 * Land units on ships will now try to draw supply from the ship they

Changes to Empire 4.0.11 - Tue Feb 10 10:53:10 EST 1998
 * AIX build seems to only work with gcc right now (but at least that works)
 * Vax Ultrix (vaxultrix) build should work now (hopefully) out of the box.
 * Took out autosupply of airports when bombing or dropping shells.
    (This was the only commodity this was done for, and it was creating
    problems since supply is still somewhat broken somewhere)
 * Included Curtis Larsen's, Markus Armbruster's and Sverker Wiberg's
    submitted patches, which collectively included cleaning up most
    of the server prototypes and bogus declarations.  Many thanks.
 * Increased incoming command buffer to 1024 from 512 bytes
 * Increased the # of parsed arguments from 64 to 100
 * Fixed bug where spies were not dying when damaged.
 * Fixed bug in HIDDEN mods in declare command not printing country # of
    uncontacted country correctly (or at all as a matter of fact)

Changes to Empire 4.0.10 - Mon Aug 18 12:34:58 EDT 1997
 * Fixed bug where fleets were being interdicted but the damage was being
    spread to ships not in the same sectors.

    are damaged.
 * Planes on ships are no longer damaged when the sectors they are in are
    damaged, unless the ship is damaged.
 * Fixed problem with no newline after partisan activity telegram in
    anti.c
 * Fixed problem in chan.c printing out change costs incorrectly.
 * Fixed problem in dispatch.c screwing things up on redirection.
 * financial should now handle 6 and 7 digit loans.
 * Planes on ships that are in sectors that revolt are no longer taken
    over.
 * Fixed bug in powe.c where the power report was mis-calculating the
    efficiency of planes.
 * Fixed doconfig.c to use STDC instead of multi-level #ifdefs.
 * Fixed bug in parse.c that was screwing up double quotes in conditional
    arguments.
 * Military in a sector now only produce up to maxpop, just like civvies
    and uw's.  No more stuffing 6K mil into a mountain to max it out.  You
    can still hold more mil there over the updates, but the extras just
    won't produce anymore.
 * Fixed bug in shark that allowed you to shark up loans even if you couldn't
    cover the debt.
 * Fixed bug in day of week calculation for server up time in common/keyword.c
    that is used for gamedays.
 * Documented what happens to standing military in collect.t when you collect
    a sector.

    population in Sector-types.t.
 * Fixed documentation on ship's firing ranges in fire.t to be less
    ambiguous.
 * Updated nukes in nuke.t
 * Added apropos command (thanks to Mike Wise)

    then whichever file is found first in the directory is used.
 * Changed documentation in wantupd.h

Changes to Empire 4.0.9 - Sat Apr 19 23:01:51 EDT 1997

 * Fixed bug in load/unload not putting a newline after some unloadings
    in allied sectors.
 * Fixed bug in harden not printing correct values.
 * Fixed bug in creating/moving/etc. nuclear stockpiles.
 * Fixed bug where subs were trying to torp commodities moving on land when
    on interdiction.  (This was funny ;-) )
 * Fixed bug in "move" where you could keep a sector even after someone else
    took it from you.
 * Budget now correctly reports the # of units being built.
 * Mil on units & ships are now reported as normal military costs, not
    ship or unit maintainence costs in budget.
 * Fixed bug in update code where taxes could potentially be initialized
    incorrectly (affected budgets too.)
 * Fixed bug in nat.h header so that it uses SCT_MAXDEF instead of a fixed
    number (that was incorrect.)

 * Revamped and improved flak.
 * Added "Flak" info page.
 * Added "Fallout" info page.
 * Fixed repay/offer/consider to all need a capital to be used.
 * Fixed bug with air defense missions not running when not AT WAR.  They now
    fly when HOSTILE.
 * plane/ship/unit short names are all now 4 characters, padded if needed.
 * pdump/sdump/ldump/ndump now just print the short name for the type.
 * sdump now has ship name at very end in quotes.
    These were done at the request of some client developers for ease of use.
 * Fixed extra space in the dump output.
 * Fixed fallout - not quite so nasty anymore.
 * Fixed fallout - things on ships/units are damaged now.
 * Fixed and balanced planes/ships/units/nukes in conjunction with each other.
 * Fixed bug in doconfig.c calculating wrong s_p_etu sometimes.
 * Fixed bug where harbors weren't being used to resupply.
 * Fixed bug where selling units loaded with planes and units wouldn't take
    the loaded planes or units - they are now dropped.
 * Fixed bug in arm/disarm where you could arm/disarm planes on the trading
    block.
 * Deities can now remove things from the trading block/market.
 * Fixed bug in "work" not charging engineers enough mob.
 * Fixed bug in "work" not adding teardown and buildup avail costs together.
 * Subs no longer need mobility to return fire when fired upon.
 * Fixed "reset".
 * Fixed bug in "trade" allowing 2 players to pay for the same item, but only
    the last player gets it.
 * Fixed bug where you couldn't launch missiles from allied ships or sectors.
 * Fixed bombing so that pin-bombing can cause collateral damage too.
 * Fixed sector damage to damage planes there too.
 * Fixed flag in lload so that it doesn't always print if not needed.
 * Fixed "sell.t" info page.
 * Fixed bug in "buy" where not entering the price correctly could cause
    a crash.
 * Fixed "sell" so that at least 1 mobility is required to sell goods.  Keeps
    the midnight "raid and sell" abuse down. :)
 * Fixed "show plane cap" to move the last column over 1 more where it should
    be.
 * Fixed timestamps to be updated for units/planes on ships/units that move,
    since those units/planes move too.

Changes to Empire 4.0.8 - Wed Feb 26 23:00:51 EST 1997
 * Fixed bug in nstr_exec that was wiping out the previous conditional.
    This was major because it affected timestamp values which are more
    than 65535.
 * Fixed bug in sdump.c for typo in reporting the trade ships origin.

Changes to Empire 4.0.7 - Mon Feb 24 22:48:54 EST 1997
 * Fixed bug in aircombat.c when calculating the air combat odds.  Negative
    numbers were screwing things up good...
 * Fort sector's coordinates are no longer printed when auto-firing at
    ships.
 * Subs can now surface and fire deck guns (again)  They can also be
    hit by return fire when doing so.
 * Fixed bug in setting of plane attack and defensive values so that
    negative numbers don't keep going further negative.
 * Fixed incorrect military control calculation in the sell command.
 * Trading posts are no longer required to sell goods from.  You can sell
    from harbors and warehouses now too.
 * Spy now prints out the owner of land units you see when spying.  Before
    this was assumed to be sector owner, which is no longer true.
 * Loading land units now prints out what was loaded onto each unit,
    just as loading ships do.
 * Added fallout, coast, c_del, m_del, c_cut and m_cut to dump output.
 * Added "GO_RENEW" option.  This option means that gold and oil resources
    are renewable.
 * Added "lost_items_timeout" config variable, and set the default to
    48 hours.  This determines how long lost items stay in the lost items
    database.
 * Fixed land unit names to be more consistent.
 * Fixed mission.t info page.
 * Fixed bug in that if mission_mob_cost was set to 0, even negative
    mob units should be able to be put on missions.
 * Removed restriction on things needing to be at least 60% to be put
    on a mission.  Note that while you can put them on missions at < 60%
    now, when trying to do the mission, it still checks the eff.  This
    is to help in automatic setup (build, put on mission, forget) instead
    of having to come back repeatedly.
 * Spies caught in Neutral or Friendly countries cause the Neutral or
    Friendly country to go Hostile towards the owner of the spy.
 * Tweaked ammunition numbers for artillery units.
 * No more automatic declarations of War should be made.  You will go
    hostile, but since going to war doesn't increase your countries
    defenses, and is purely political, it is left to the player to go
    that final step.
 * Fixed bug in trade that wasn't incrementing the time if last second bidding.
 * Fixed bug in "lmine" that was crashing the server if the land unit was
    out of mobility.
 * Fixed buy so that if you specify a product, you can only bid on that
    type of product.
 * Added "lost.t" info page.
 * Added "lost items" database (EF_LOST)
 * Fixed bug where you could move in allied forces after an attack if they
    bordered the victim area.
 * Fixed nstr_comp to deal with values > 16 bits coming in from
    client for comparisons.
 * Changed last minute market/trade timers to increment 5 minutes.  2 minutes
    was too quick.
 * Fixed decode in lib/common/nstr_subs.c to deal with NSC_TIME better.
 * Commented out the logging of the market checking in server/marketup.c,
    lib/commands/buy.c and lib/commands/trad.c  It was generating lots of
    pretty much useless data that made parsing the server.log file more
    more difficult than it needed to be.
 * Fixed crashing bug in ldump.
 * sdump, ldump, ndump, pdump and dump now print out the current
    timestamp on the "DUMP XXX" line.
 * Fixed denial of service bug in lib/player/accept.c in
    player_find_other function.
 * Fixed bug in shark reporting incorrect buyer of the loan.
 * Fixed bug in sdump.c (case 0 should have been case 10)
 * ldump and sdump now always print the fuel column if asked for,
    even if opt_FUEL is turned off.  In the case that it is turned
    off, the fuel is listed as 0.
 * Added "timestamp" field, which is updated every time an item is
    changed.
 * Fixed up the Clients.t info page.
 * sdump now prints trade ship building origin.
 * sdump now always prints name even if SHIPNAMES isn't defined.  If
    it is not defined, then the name is empty.
 * Added "timestamp" to info/Concepts/Selector.t
 * Added some more relevant info to info/Server/Empire4.t
 * Fixed Infrastructure.t info page to reflect the fact that infrastructure
    is no longer torn down when a sector is re-designated.
 * Fixed sell.t to more accurately reflect the time-delay market.
 * Fixed read.t and wire.t to reference accept and reject.
 * Fixed reject.t not referencing accept command.
 * Fixed collect.t to more accurately reflect what goes on when collecting
    sectors.
 * Fixed financial.t to reflect defaulted loans.
 * Fixed dump.t, sdump.t, ldump.t, ndump.t, pdump.t to reflect new
    timestamp info.
 * Fixed "census.t" (had incorrect reference to "info syntax" instead
    of "info Syntax".

Changes to Empire 4.0.6 - Thu Jan 16 11:33 EST 1997
 * Increased damage from depthcharges because on increased damage from
    torpedos.  Sub frange decreased to be more balanced with destroyer frange.
 * Intelligence reports (spy) on units will now report the estimated number
    of mil on the unit.
 * Fixed equation for ship visibility so it will drop as tech increases.
 * Added new commands sdump, ldump, pdump, and ndump to dump data on ships,
    land units, planes, and nukes.
 * If fields are provided, dump will only supply those fields requested.
 * Decreased speed of subs.
 * When options NO_LCMS or NO_HCMS are set, those commodities are no longer
    required for infrastructure improvements.
 * Units that lose an assault or a boarding attempt from a ship will no
    longer swim back to the ship they came from.
 * Units that take extra casualties will no longer lose all their mil at
    once.
 * Infrastucture is retained when redesignating a sector.
 * Dieing spies will no longer crash the server.
 * Units, planes, and ships must have mobility to perform missions.
 * Units on ship being scrapped are transferred to harbor.
 * Food is no longer autoloaded onto units when they are built.
 * Fixed show plane stat to show correct range.
 * Infantries now take damage at same rate as casualties.
 * Fixed bug with hap_fact.  Having more happiness now helps with fighting
    che.
 * Fixed anti to write back target country so che will continue to fight
    when they survive.
 * Fixed llookout to show correct estimate on number of mil on unit.
 * Added buildable architecture "hp".  This type will build the server on
    a HP/UX machine using the standard compiler instead of gcc.

Changes to Empire 4.0.5 - Thu Dec 12 10:28:48 EST 1996
 * Fixed bug in update/distribute.c where pathcost was not being called with
    the MOB_ROAD argument (and thus distribution costs could be GREATLY
    affected.) - Thanks Ice!

Changes to Empire 4.0.4 - Mon Dec  9 11:00:00 EST 1996
 * Fixed Solaris port using gcc.
 * Fixed doconfig.c to create directories with right modes.
 * Fixed install macros in makefiles to move binaries to the right
    places.

Changes to Empire 4.0.3 - Wed Dec  4 22:46:53 EST 1996
 * Added HP/UX port.
 * Fixed doconfig.c (put exit(0) at the end of main.)
 * Fixed improve.c (moved the prompt[] string outside the fcn.)

Changes to Empire 4.0.2 - Mon Oct 14 12:26:40 EDT 1996
 * Put in LND_MINMOBCOST in land.h
 * Put in change in lnd_mobcost in lndsub.c
 * Put in new nuke costs in nuke.c
 * Put in fix so that total work can only be done by the max pop. No more extra
    civvies tossed in will do it anymore in human.c.
 * Put in fix for src/util/Makefile - beefed it up.
 * Put in fix to show where your ship is when it gets shelled in mfir.c.
 * Changed infrastructure of roads from .040 to .020 (122 instead of 150 in
    common/move.c)
 * Fixed Update-sequence.t.
 * Put in fix for mobcost bonus for 0% highways.
 * Fixed stop.t
 * Fixed commodity.t
 * Spruced up torpedo damage somewhat. :) :)
 * Fixed "assault bmap bug" in attsub.c
 * Fixed Produce.t (bars cost)
 * Changed mountains to get an automatic "2" for defensive bonus in attsub.c
 * Fixed consider.t
 * Fixed repay.t
 * Fixed offer.t
 * Fixed "offer" and "consider" not being legal commands in player/empmod.c
 * Fixed Damage.t
 * Fixed sstat.t
 * Fixed lstat.c, pstat.c and sstat.c
 * Fixed cutoff command in cuto.c
 * Fixed attack value in attack_val in lndsub.c
 * Fixed lload in commands/load.c
 * Fixed defense_val in lndsub.c - Made it a minimum of 1, so that units will
    always fight until dead or retreating.  0 makes them get stuck.
 * Fixed update/deliver.c - no delivery of non-oldowned civvies (or anything
    else for that matter.)
 * Fixed llook in commands/look.c
 * Fixed che bug in subs/nstr.c
 * Fixed bug in strv.c by overcompensating by 1 food per sector (minute amounts
    of people would starve.)
 * Fixed update/human.c - feed_people rounding problems (I hope.)
 * Fixed morale problem in update/land.c
 * Fixed count_bodies in attsub.c
 * Fixed lnd_mobcost.
 * Fixed subs/land,plane,ship.c to handle sunken units and planes correctly.
 * Fixed interest rate in commands/offe.c
 * Fixed bug in buy.c.
 * Put in DEFENSE_INFRA soption o you can turn on/off the use of the defensive
    infrastructure.  When off, the defensive infrastructure is the same
    as the sector efficiency, and you can't improve it.  This is OFF by
    default.
 * Fixed Empire4.t
 * Added Wolfpack.t
 * Land units are now built with a default reaction radius of 0.
 * Changed name of lt artilleries to "lat" from "lart" so you can now build
    "lar"s again.
 * Lowered the speed and firing range of pt boats.
 * Lowered the initial att strength of cavs from 1.5 to 1.3 (they were TOO
    powerful.)
 * Changed the max mob gain defaults of units/planes to 1.0 and ships to 1.5
    (This is * ETU_RATE, so it is equal to ETU_RATE for units/planes and
     1.5 * ETU_RATE for ships.)
 * Conquered civvies only pay 1/4 taxes.
 * Railways don't get torn down when you rebuild sectors anymore (but roads
    and defenses do (if enabled.)

Changes to Empire 4.0.1 - Wed Aug 28 11:35:40 EDT 1996
 * Added "extern double tradetax" to check_trade in trad.c
 * Improved description of data directory in build.conf
 * Fixed bug in attacking land units that retreat so they now get
    charged mobility for attacking.
 * Fixed dump to report road, rail and defense of a sector at the end.
 * Fixed doconfig bug in not checking the right directory to see if the
    "data" directory existed or not before trying to create it.
 * "change" now works for sanctuary countries.
 * Fixed the description of "sinfrastructure".
 * Added more info to "Infrastructure".
 * Units/planes are no longer reduced to 75% when bought from the trading
    block.
 * Supply units were slowed down to the speed of infantry units.
 * Trade-ship payoffs have been lowered to 2.5, 3.5 and 5.0
 * Bars interest is up to $250 per 1K again.
 * Civ taxes were raised back up to a 10:1 mil/civ tax ratio (was 20:1)
 * Fixed various info pages.
 * Fixed bug in people not getting truncated when broke (this was thought
    to be fixed, but wasn't. Now it is, dammit!)
 * Fixed bug with units marching across oceans (scuba gear not included. ;-) )
 * Market/trade taxes and trade ship payoff figures were added to version.
 * "cede" has been removed as a default command.
 * Makefile rule was fixed for depend build.
 * Fixed bug in mapdist not taking world edges into account nicely enough.
 * Added a "scuttle" order for autoscuttling trade ships.  Makes using them
    easier.  Cleaned up scuttle code while in there.
 * Fixed bug with scuttling a ship with units on it not scuttling the units
    too.

Changes to Empire 4.0.0 - Wed Aug 21 1996
 * Initial Wolfpack release - Long live the Wolfpack!!!!
 * Cleaned up the build environment.  Now all that is needed is to edit the
    build.conf file, answer the questions there and type "make <arch>" to
    build for a specific architecture.  Thus, no more reliance on gnumake
    or special shell scripts.
 * We are now shipping the pre-built info pages with the server for those who
    Don't want to build them.  You can also still just type "make" and have
    the info pages build, but it doesn't completely work (i.e. rebuild new
    Subjects) if you don't have perl5 installed.
 * Put in the "help" command that does the same thing as "info".
 * Removed C_SYNC.  This is done for 2 reasons.  1) None of us like it or
    wish to support it.  2) We envision a better scheme for doing similar
    things will come along.
 * Put in MOB_ACCESS - This allows real-time updating of mobility.
 * Put in MARKET - This is the time-based market (yes, still teleports,
    but it's not as bad as it was.)
 * Lots of the documenation has been updated, but there is more to do.
 * Added NO_LCMS, NO_HCMS and NO_OIL options.  When any of these options are
    enabled, you don't need any of that type of material to build things.
    If NO_HCMS is enabled, you don't need HCMS to build bridges, you need
    lcms.  If both NO_HCMS and NO_LCMS are enabled, then you don't need
    any materials to build a bridge.
 * There is no mobility cost for assigning missions.  But, there is also
    no longer any benefit for being on a mission either.
 * Damage is the same for all commodities (people too.)  This means you
    can deity shell/bomb sectors again.
 * Units are now dependant on tech.  What this means is that their statistics
    now increase with tech.  In addition, there is only 1 type of each basic
    unit now (i.e. just "cavalry" instead of "cavalry 1", "cavalry 2", etc.)
    This reflects the idea that as you learn more, you learn how to not only
    build better units, but you learn to build units better. :)  This also
    opens the door for a "lupgrade" command along the same lines as the
    "upgrade" command for ships.
 * Units now have a minimum mob cost for attacking a sector.  Marching
    mob costs have not changed.
 * Starting units have been removed.  This means that at the beginning, people
    may live a little longer since their neighbor can't come visiting quite
    as quick.
 * Shells are no longer required to build units.
 * Mil are no longer required to build units.
 * Mil are no longer an intrinsic part of a unit.  They are now a loadable
    commodity.  The way a unit's defense/att bonuses work now are
        attack = (att * mil * eff)
        defense = (def * mil * eff)
    In addition, when a unit takes damage, both the eff and the mil go
    down.  You can quickly toss in new hacks, but you need to wait to repair
    the unit at the update.  Thus, you can now look at unit's efficiency
    as their training.
 * You need at least 1 mil on a unit to march it (spies are the exception.)
 * Units always react if in range and they have the mobility, no matter
    what their efficency.
 * Units may now march anywhere - in your own sectors, deity owned sectors
    or allied sectors, with 1 exception, spies.  Also, your units can get
    trapped if your ally declares non-alliance with you while your units
    are still in his country.)
 * Units always march at their speed, efficiency doesn't matter.
 * LANDSPIES was added - This creates land unit based spies.  Spies may march
    anywhere, with a chance of getting caught (except in allied territory.)
    See "info Spies" for more info on them.
 * Planes may now be based out of allied airports.  Landing planes on
    ships/sectors you do not own no longer changes thier owner.  You can only
    land on owned/allied sectors/ships, and you may only
    fly/bomb/para/recon/drop from owned/allied sectors.  So, if a country
    you are allied with goes hostile at you, your planes are now stuck there.
    Note that if you are using an allied airport, their commodities get
    sucked up, not yours (obviously.)
 * Planes are now tech-based.  Their statistics increase as their tech
    increases.  Deleted extraneous planes.
 * There is a new toggle, "techlists", which allows you to see what you
    can build/stats/capabilities sorted by tech instead of groupings.
 * Ships are now tech-based.  Their statistics increase as their tech
    increases.  Deleted extraneous ships.
 * Che can now be lessened by making happiness.  If you have more happiness
    than your conquered populace, they don't fight as hard or recruit as
    much.  If you have less than them, they fight harder and recruit more.
    It's not much though - it ranges from 2.0 in your favor to only 0.8
    against you (whereas it was always 1.0 before.)  So, it definitely
    favors the attackers to make lots of happy now.
 * Bridgeheads can only be built on coasts.
 * Players command was fixed so you only see allies, and don't get
    approx #'s of players anymore.
 * POSIX threads support has been added.
 * The attack bmap bug has been fixed.
 * BTUs regenerate 3 times faster now.
 * GRAB_THINGS is off by default.
 * Big nuclear bombs are back, and FALLOUT has been fixed and enabled
    as a default (you couldn't make wasteland before with FALLOUT, now
    you can.)
 * You can now deliver military and civilians.
 * Added SHIP_DECAY option - off by default (turns off ships decaying out
    at sea if not enough mil.)
 * The reverting owner bug has been fixed in territory, thresh, dist
    and deliver.  There are probably more, and when found, will be fixed.
 * The "sectors don't starve when stopped or broke" bug has been fixed.
 * The "people never get truncated" bug has been fixed.
 * Added infrastructure to sectors.  What this means is that a sector
    can now have it's mobility improved by building both roads and
    railways.  It also means that a sectors defense is now based on the
    defensive infrastructure you build into the sector (no more intrinsic
    better defenses based on the sector, you determine which sectors are
    defended heavily, and which aren't.)
 * The defensive value of a sector no longer relies on the efficiency of
    the sector. Instead, it relies on the defensive efficiency of the sector.
    Thus, the "production" and "defensive" aspects of sectors have been
    separated.
 * "show sect stats" now shows the maximum defensive value for sectors.
 * Changed sector structure to take floats for off/def values so we can use
    a base of 1 instead of 2.
 * Added "improve" and "sinfrastructure" to support the infrastructure
    concepts.
 * Added L_TRAIN units which can only travel along railways.  Very fast on
    efficient railways, slow on non-efficient ones.
 * Added the ability for units to carry other units.
 * Fixed census (shortened up "fallout" and "coast" to "fall" and "coa".)
 * Forts only cost $500 to build and 100 hcms now (since they don't get any
    better defenses automagically.)
 * Modified "show sect build" to show the costs for building up the
    infrastructure of a sector.
 * Changed "spy" and the satellite recon stuff (which shows sector stuff for
    spyplanes too) to show the new infrastructure stuff, rounded of course.
 * Added Drake's info->html scripts, with some modifications, so you can
    now type "make html" and have your info pages built as html files too.
    This adds a new directory, "info.html", to the build tree.
 * Modified upgrade so that planes and land units may now be upgraded.
 * Added pstat command to list the statistics of your planes.
 * Added lstat command to list the statistics of your land units.
 * Added sstat command to list the statistics of your ships.
 * Added nmap command to show a map of your sectors after their new
    designations have taken place.
